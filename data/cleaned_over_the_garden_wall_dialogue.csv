Narrator,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Somewhere, lost in the clouded annals of history, lies a place that few have seen—a mysterious place, called the Unknown—where long forgotten stories are revealed to those who travel through the wood..."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"... Antelope, Guggenheim, Albert, Salami, Giggly, Jumpy, Tom, Thomas, Tambourine, Leg-Face McCullen, Artichoke, Penguin, Pete, Steve... But I think the very worst name for this frog is—"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Wait, wait a second. Uh...Greg?"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Where—are we?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,In the woods?
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,I mean... what are we doing out here?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,We're walking home!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Greg! I, I think we're lost! We, w-we should've left a trail or something."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,I can leave a trail of candy from my pants!!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"No. though I am lost, my wounded heart resides back home—in pieces—strewn about the graveyard of my lost love. For only—"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Do you hear that?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Yeah.
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Do you think it's some kind of deranged lunatic with an axe waiting out there in the darkness for innocent victims?  Greg!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Greg, you're going to get us into trouble again!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,We should ask him for help!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"No, we should not ask him for help."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,But—!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shh!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,You shh!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,You shh!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shhh—!!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shoot. Y-You think we should've asked him for help?
Beatrice,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Hey. Maybe I can help you. I mean, you guys are lost, right?"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"What, in the world is going on?!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Well you're slapping yourself, and I'm answering your question, and—"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"No, Greg. A - a bird's brain isn't big enough for cognizant speech."
Beatrice,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Hey, what was that?"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"I mean, I-I'm just saying, you're, you're weird. Like, not normal. I, I mean—  Oh my gosh, stop talking to it, Wirt..."
Beatrice,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,It?
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,What're you doing here?! Explain yourselves!!
Beatrice,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Aaand I'll see you guys later, bye."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Calm—calm down, mister! Wh-Whatever you do here is your business! W-W-We just wanna get home with all our legs and arms attached!!"
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"These woods are no place, for children! Don't you know the Beast is afoot here?"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"The Beast?  We don't know anything about that! W-We're just two lost kids, trying to get home!"
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Well, welcome to the Unknown, boys. You're more lost than you realize."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"I found this homestead abandoned, and repurposed its mill for my needs.  You and your brother should be safe here, while I work."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Candy trail, candy trail, can-dy-trail..."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"What, what is your—work, exactly?"
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Everyone has a torch to burn,  and this here's mine. I grind the horrid Edelwood trees into oil, to keep this lantern lit.  This is my lot in life, this is my burden."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"This guy sounds loony. Maybe we should make a break for it, i-if we can. But he must know the woods really well, so we may need to knock him out, first. Except—that might turn out really badly, huh? Yeah, bad, bad plan, eh, forget it, bad plan."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Okay.
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,What're you boys whispering about?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,We were talking about runnin' away outta here.
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shh!!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shh—
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shh!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Shoosh!!
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Leave, if you wish. But remember: the Beast haunts these woods,  ever singiiiing, his moournful melodyyy...  —in search of lost souls, such as yourselves!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,To help us?
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"No, not to help you.  I have work to do in the mill. When I'm finished, I will do what I can to guide you. If you are still here when I return."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Huh. I guess—we could just leave. But, eh, I don't know...—Greg!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,What?
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Do you think there really is a Beast out there?  Or, is, is that guy just messing with us?"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Uh-huh.
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"I mean, he could've done away with us by now, if that was his plan. And he lit that fire, that's—pretty nice."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Yeah!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"I guess it's possible there's a Beast, since there was a talking bird, but..."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Yeah!!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"I dunno. Sometimes I feel like I'm just like...  a boat, upon a winding river... twisting, towards an endless black sea..."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Further, and further, drifting away... from where I want to be —who!—I want to be..."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Oh, I didn't know that. Did you know, that if you soak a raisin in grape juice, it turns into a grape?  It's a rock fact!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Augh, you're not helping at all. Why don't you go play with your frog, or something?"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Aw, beans! Where is that frog o' mine? Hold on there, second-brother o' mine! I'll be back soon for your plan."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Kitty!! Kitty?? Now where did that frog named 'Kitty' go? Whup--  I tripped on my own candy trail!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Hm?  That frog's givin' me the run-around.
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Kitty?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Gross.
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Kitty??
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Hmm...is that—woah!!  Oh, there you are!!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Wirt?  ...Kitty??
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,You have beautiful eyes!!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Yeugh...  Greg?  Uh...?
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,What's happening? Where's your brother?
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Ah-enuh!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Oh holy moley, hot dog—!!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,It's the Beast!!
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Stay back, boys!  This creature, which is known as——huh??"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"GREG, WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"That was the plan, remember? Knock him out!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Eh—no! Ah, bad plan!!  I told you to forget that plan!!!  Ahhhhh!!!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Spank, spank... spank!!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Run run run run run run run!!!!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Caaaandyyy, camouflage!  Run run run run run run run!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Greg!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"This is amazing, huh??"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Am I supposed to throw something?  Oh yeah!  Haha!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,He's eating your candy?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,I wonder if he ate my whole candy trail that lead to this mill!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Augh!  Greg!! You lead the Beast right to us with your candy!
Wirt and Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Euh...
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Hey,  gimme the axe; you're too little to have it anyway, I—  —we gotta, we gotta get outta here!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Uhh, G-Greg, eh, g-give him the rest of your candy!!"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Whoops!
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Hey Wirt, look!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Greg?
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Wirt!  He spit out that turtle, and now he's my new best friend!!  Ouhh—oh... Hey, where ya goin'??"
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Ain't that just the way...
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,The mill is destroyed...the oil! All gone!!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"—But, b-but look! We, w-we got the Beast problem solved."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,That dog?! That is NOT the Beast!!  The Beast cannot be mollified like some farmer's pet!!!
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"He stalks, like the night—  —he sings like the Four Winds—  —he is the Death of Hope!! He steals their children, and, he'll... ruin..."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"You're always messing up, Greg."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Boy! You have it backwards! You are the elder child! You are responsible for you, and your brother's actions!!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Ah, Ahm, I-I'm sorry. Maybe I can—fix it?  I—I can't fix it."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,You must go.  Take your brother north. Look for a town!
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Yeah. Thanks.  Come on, Greg."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"One last thing. Beware, the Unknown! Fear the Beast! And leave these woods!!  If you can.  It is your burden to bear!"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Right, yeah—ah—got it."
The Woodsman,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"And you, little one. You look after that frog; give it a proper name."
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Okay.
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Wirt, I think I thought of a new name for our frog. I'm gonna call him, 'Wirt.'"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,That's—gonna be really confusing.
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"No, I'm gonna call you 'Kitty.'"
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,What?  Maybe I'll start calling you 'Candy Pants.'
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,"Woah, yeah!!  Good one, Wirt."
Wirt,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,Thanks.
Greg,Episode 1: The Old Grist Mill,I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to Wirt!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"It's almost morning. We should've found a town by now.  This—is the way the Woodsman told us to go, right?"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Have you listened to anything I've been saying? For the last couple of hours I've been saying—
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, that settles it——I'm gonna walk up ten feet ahead of you."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Help!
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Huh?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I'm stuck!
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I hear something!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"It's probably nothing. Hey, look.  Pottsfield, one mile.  A town! Let's go this way!"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Alright. Let's go this way.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Not—
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Hello?  Hello?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Hey, you!"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Who, me?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Yeah, you!"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oh, hello!"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,It's you again. I'm stuck. Help me out of here and I'll owe you a favor!
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Woah, I get a wish?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"No-no-no, not a wish. I'm not magical. I'll just do you a good turn."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Can you turn me into a tiger?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Uh, no—I just said I'm not magical."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,It doesn't have to be a magical tiger.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Greg, stop talking to a bush."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Okay.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Huh?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Thanks! I owe you a favor, so, um—  —you two are lost kids with no purpose in life, right?"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh-huh.
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"How about I bring you to Adelaide of the Pasture, the Good Woman of the Woods?  She can help you get home!"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oooh!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"No, no. No, no. No-no-no-no-no.  Magic, talking birds, leading us to fairy godmothers, in a mysterious—  —I'm going to Pottsfield."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Yeah! We're going to Pottsfield!  Come on!
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What about the favor?
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I'll think of my wish later.
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Ugh...
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"So, let's small talk. My name's Greg. What's yours?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Beatrice.
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,My brother's name is Wirt—
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Who cares?
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"—and, my frog's name is Wirt Jr., but that may change."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Okay, that's great.  How about you and I ditch your brother?"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Mmm, maybe later.  So is it nice being a bird?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Nope.
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oh.  —Do you like waffles?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"No, waffles make me sick. I eat——..mmmaggots..."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What?
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,How can you not eat waffles?!
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What?!
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I stepped on a pumpkin!!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,A-ha!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Civilization! See? Now—  —huh? What the?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Alright. Let's rejoin society.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Hello?  Hellooo? — Hrm. See anybody?
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Nooooo—oh!  I see you.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Yeah, I—see you too, Greg."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Hey, not to be obnoxious, but an abandoned ghost town doesn't seem like it's gonna be that useful getting you guys home."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,There's gotta be somebody.  Somewhere.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Excuse me. Anyone here?  Hello?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oh. — Sorry. Uh — I'm — looking for a ph—um.  Um, I'm sorry!"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Did you find anything?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Nope. Where's Greg?
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Do you hear that?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Huh? [A vocal chanting melody, Pottsfield CM, starts up in the background from a barn down the road. The brothers gasp to each other, and the group all approach the barn with a couple more 'huh?'s."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What the—?
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oho, pardon me there.  Say, you folks ought to don your vegetables and celebrate the harvest with us."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh...  Oh!  You're wearing costumes!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, sure. Pumpkins can't move on their own! Can they?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Ha. No. Yeah, no."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Good thing I didn't take this off!
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"You guys find this place as creepy as I do, right?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"So, it's some kind of weird cult, where they wear vegetable costumes, and dance around a big thing.  They seem nice enough."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Okay. You're in denial. That's fine.  But I'm just saying... Something feels off about this place.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, maybe I can find someone here,  who'll give us a ride home. Greg, you stay out of trouble. Beatrice, thank you, but you can leave."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I can't leave. I'm honor-bound to help you since you guys helped me. That's the—bluebird rules.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Ah, okay."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Beatrice, would you care for this dance?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,No thanks.  No thanks—no thanks!—I said no thank you!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Say, aren't you a little too—early?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What do you mean?
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"I mean, it doesn't seem like you're ready to join us just yet."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Join you? — Yeah, no, I'm just — passing through."
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Folks don't tend to ""pass through"" Pottsfield."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oh.  Yeah?
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Yeah. It's nice here.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Um. I'm really just looking t-to leave here,  as fast as possible."
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Eh, what, what? Leave Pottsfield? Who wants to leave Pottsfield?!"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Huh? — What? — He wants to leave Pottsfield.
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oh, are we leaving already?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Let's leave immediately!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I'm — just trying to get home.
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,They're not supposed to be here. Maybe he's here to steal our crops. To ruin our party.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Or take off our pumpkin shoes!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Uh — no, I, uh —"
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, now, hold on everybody. Heh, let's not jump to any conclusions."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Woah.
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Enoch, what shall we do with them?"
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I-I'm done.
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, now,  let's see here, boys. How'd you end up in this little town of ours?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, we were trying to get home. We came into town from the woods. Ehh, we saw your farms, and your houses, and thought, ""hey, here's a normal place with normal people."""
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,And we both stepped on pumpkins!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Y-Yeah! A-And then, we heard the music from the barn, and, well—uh—h-how about we just leave?"
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Heh, now let me get this straight: you come to our town, you trample our crops—you interrupt our private engagement—and now you wanna leave?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh—yes.
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,You'll never convict!  You have no proof!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,This one's trying to escape.
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Let me go! I don't know these clowns!
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Children... it saddens me that you don't wish to stay here with us,  particularly because I simply have to punish you for your transgressions."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I told you this place was bad news!
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"So by~ the order of the Pottsfield Chamber of Commerce,  I find you guilty of trespassing, destruction of property,   disturbing the peace,  and murder."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,M-Murder?!
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oho, no, not murder. But for those other crimes, I sentence you to... a few hours of manual labor."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Wait, what? Really? That's it?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Ha-ha!  Just a few hours of manual labor,  and we're almost done."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"And then what are you going to do? — Just wander around, this way and that way, through the woods, forever more?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Uhh—uhh, maybe we'll just stay in Pottsfield. It's nice here!  I don't know.  I don't know."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Why do they even have you digging these holes?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Plantin' seeds, or—something..."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Maybe they're gonna bury you out there!
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Hey! Buried treasure!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Woah, really?  See, Beatrice?  What'd you find?"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,A skeleton!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,We're digging our own—  I-I-I was wrong. I was wrong all along. I-I don't know how to get us home—u-use your little feet to pick our locks!
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oho! Now you want my help?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"I don't want your help, but—"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Yes! I want your help! Beatrice, serious—"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Your time is up!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Them holes been dug?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh... yeah...
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Splendid! Well then—
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"B-But, no."
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,No?
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh...
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Psst!
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Keep stalling!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Right. Yeah! Uh, you know, we were digging, and—there were too many rocks. You guys don't like rocks—right?"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I don't think we do...
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"No, we don't like rocks."
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I don't think so...
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"See?  So, we were like, ""We should get rid of these rocks."""
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, that's a good idea."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Right?  Yeah, so, we were getting rid of the rocks, and—  —huh? Huh?  What?  They left me..."
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"—So, what happened to the rocks?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh... the rocks.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Yeah, they—they were, um, you know—they—they—they got in the way of all the—well, the dirt, you know, and...  W-Woahh, ohohh?!"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Welcome back, Larry!"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,He looks exactly the same!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What in the...?
Larry,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Whooooooop—woo!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Yeah, Larry! Woo! Yeah, go, Larry, look at that guy go!"
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Edward, this one's for you!"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,They're all... skeletons!
Pottsfield Villager,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Thanks for diggin' up the life of the party!
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Ah, what a wonderful harvest...  And what about you? You sure you wanna leave?"
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Me?  Yes.
Enoch,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Oh, well.  You'll join us someday..."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Uh...
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Psst!  Why are you still here?!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,What do you mean?! You guys left me!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oh.
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Come on!
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Oh—a-are they chasing us?
Greg and Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Nope.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I-I thought you guys—
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,You're welcome.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Thank you. — I guess we're even now, huh?  You're not honor-bound to help us out anymore."
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I wish. But you weren't actually in any danger with those weirdos.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Ohhh yeah! Then, you still have to help us get home!"
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I got it!  I wish Wirt Jr. had fingernails so he could play the guitar better.
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Soooo—yeah, I'll bring you to Adelaide. I mean, that's where I'm going anyway."
Greg,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,Why are you going to Adelaide's?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"I guess in some ways, I'm trying to get home, too."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,That's vague. What does that mean?
Beatrice,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I don't have to tell you anything.
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,"Well, I sure hope Adelaide is more helpful than that Woodsman was."
Wirt,Episode 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee,I think his directions were... not very good.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Don't know who she is Or how she is, or when, what, why she is But as for where she is She is where we will go To Adelaide! To Adelaide! Come on, and join the Adelaide parade"
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,No.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Adelaide! To Adelaide! Let's go to Adelaide's house
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"I need to fix that last part, but that's the idea. So, Beatrice, you sing the high part. Wirt, you sing the really high part."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,What? Oh.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,And --
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Nobody is singing anything anymore. And, Wirt, keep moving."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,But I-I have to -- Ugh. All right.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,But we have to do something fun.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"You know, we really don't. We can just keep walking silently, you know? And -- Ugh. Wirt, let's go. Come on."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Sorry, sorry."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,But shouldn't we --
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Greg, don't you want to be more like your brother -- just always doing what you're told..."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Huh?
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,...Just a pathetic pushover who relies on others to make all his decisions?
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Hey! What? I'm not a pushover.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hold on, Wirt. Let me get to my point."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Fine.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"See, Greg? No willpower whatsoever."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Hrmph!
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,You need to be more like that.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,But that doesn't really sound that fun.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"The world is a miserable place, Greg. Life isn't fun."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Then I'll do what I need to do, I guess."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Thank you. We'll just focus on getting you guys to Adelaide's so I can wash my hands of this whole affair, and if you could pick up the pace a bit, that'd be great, okay? Okay? Hey, where's Greg?"
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh. Uh, wandered off, I guess."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Cheese and crackers!
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,We need to do our part to make the world a better place!
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Yeah.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Huh? Whoa!
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,School?!  Not today.
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Greg! Greg! Greg?
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Excuse me?
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Please, take your seat, children. You're late. You know the rules -- ""Once the bell has run, class has begun."""
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, sorry, everybody. Sorry. No, he doesn't have a brain. He can't learn anything. Let's go, wirt. Come on.  Here, boy."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,What? Did you say something? I can't hear you because I'm too busy doing what I'm told.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"What? What are you --  no, no. Let's go."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, no. See, I'm a pushover, remember? I have to do what she tells me to do."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Ohh. Wirt, your brother could be in trouble somewhere."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Ha-Ha! Yeah!
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Bluebirds have a short life span. You two are literally killing me every moment I'm forced to spend with you.
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Oh.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Young man, I will not stand for such nonsense in my classroom. I got enough nonsense from that no good, two-timing, low-down handsome man of mine. Oh, Jimmy Brown, why did you have to leave me so? And now, with my father threatening to close the school and that wild gorilla on the loose, why, Jimmy, I just have one thing to say..."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"""A"" is for the apple that he gave to me, But I found a worm inside. ""B"" is for beloved that I call to him before he-"
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Oof. That lady's got some baggage.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"What's that? Young man, go to the dunce box."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh. Sure, Okay."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"No, No."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Sure. Wirt gets up from his seat and proceeds to put himself into the dunce box.
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"No, No."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Aw.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Now, where were we? Oh, yes. ""G"" is for the gentlemen I thought he was When he first said hi,"
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"So, my theory is hot dogs are not actually dogs, regardless of what they teach you in school. But you guys don't go to school, huh? I'm gonna stick with you guys."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Ha-ha! Hey, I got an idea. Let's play ""Two old cat."" do you guys know how to play ""Two old cat""? It's fun. I'll show you. Here we go. Here's one old cat. Greg brings up an old looking cat.  The deer in the crowd picks up another, much older cat. It dons a beard and spectacles, and hold a cane."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,You found another one! Wait. No. I think that cat is too old.
Very Old Cat,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Rowr.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Sorry, kitty. We'll have to find another old cat. Hey, jeffrey, I think there's one behind you!"
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,GORILLA! RUN!
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"And “Y”, yes “Y”, Is the question that’s on my mind. Oh why,"
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hey, dunce. This is dreadful!"
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Good. I'm glad you feel that way.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,I remember like -- huh?
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,GORILLA!
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Mealtime already? Well, come along children."
Gorilla,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Huh?
Gorilla,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Aah!
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Mm-Hmm.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"We don't want to be late for mealtime. My father will be visiting today, and we'll need to be on our best behavior."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"QUICK! IN HERE!  Oh, boy! Mealtime! This is way better than being chased by a gorilla."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Aw, what's the matter? Mm. Kind of bland."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hey, nobody ordered you to eat yet."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Yeah, but... mm."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Hmm.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Ohh.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hey! I know what to do! Here, Miss Langtree. Play something like this."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, like this?"
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Mm...Good enough.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, potatoes and molasses If you want some, oh, just ask us They're warm and soft like puppies in socks Filled with cream and candy rocks Oh, potatoes and molasses They're so much sweeter than algebra classes If your stomach is grumblin' and your mouth starts a-mumblin' There is only one thing to keep your brain from crumblin' Oh, potatoes and molasses If you can't see 'em, put on your glasses They're shiny and large like a fisherman's barge You know you've eat enough when you start seeing stars Oh, potatoes and molasses It's the only thing left on your task list They're short and stout to make everyone shout For, potatoes and molasses For, potatoes and-"
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,THAT'S ENOUGH!
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Father
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Is this what I've been paying for?!
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hey, we just wanted to have a little fun."
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"I didn't invest in this school for fun. I thought we were trying to do important work here, teaching animals to count and spell."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"We are! Oh, please, Father, don't close the school. It won't happen again."
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,I should say it won't.
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,THIS...
School House Deer,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,PBHT!
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,...THIS...
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,...And this are all coming with me. Now send them to bed!
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,You heard Father. Off to bed with you.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"I just wanted to have fun, change the world, and make it a better place. But I just made everything worse."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Okay, Wirt, I'll admit it -- you seem like a pushover, but you're not."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Oh?
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Deep down in your heart, you're a stubborn jerk. When are you gonna give this up?"
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Maybe never. Maybe I'll never give this up.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Hmm. Yeah! Wirt's right -- never give up! Come on, Wirt. Let's go save the day."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Okay, if you say so"
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Come on.
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"So, what's the plan, Greg?"
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Plan? Ohh. I don't know.
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Ohh! Who would've thought making a primer school for animals was a bad idea? My life savings, my home -- everything I had went into that dear, dear school. And now I'm forced to sell these instruments just to keep it open. All the while that loathsome Jimmy Brown is off gallivanting who knows where! Not to mention that wild gorilla on the loose.  if only something would go right for a change."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Okay, I think he's asleep. Let's go steal his stuff."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,What?
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,The instruments! They've been stolen! Who would do such a thing?! Huh?
Concert Guest,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Here you go.
Concert Guest,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, here you go, Sonny."
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,What is this?
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,It's a benefit concert for the school.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Ah, isn't it grand -- all these fine people giving out of the goodness of their hearts?  not like my Jimmy Brown."
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Ohh, here we go."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,All he ever did was steal my heart away.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,GORILLA!
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,AAH!
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Young man, do something!"
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Uh...
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Whoa!
Jimmy,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Finally.
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Jimmy?
Jimmy,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"That's right, Darlin'. I was the gorilla."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,But why did you do it?
Jimmy,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Got a job in the circus so's I could finally buy ya that wedding ring. But when I got stuck in the dang suit, everybody was too doggone scared to help me out."
Miss Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Aw, Jimmy. Oh!"
Jimmy,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Darlin'.
Mr. Langtree,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,I guess the world really is as sweet as potatoes and molasses.
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Oh, potatoes and molasses, If you want some..."
Wirt,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"So, want me to tell Greg it's time to get going?"
Beatrice,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,"Nah, let him have his fun."
Greg,Episode 3: Schooltown Follies,Filled with cream and candy and rocks

Greg,Episode 8: Babes in the Wood,REALLY? IT WAS ALL MY FAULT?
Wirt,Episode 8: Babes in the Wood,"YEAH, SO...IT'S NOT MY JOB TO GET US HOME, OKAY? I'M DONE."
Greg,Episode 8: Babes in the Wood,ARE YOU SAYING I SHOULD BE THE LEADER?
Wirt,Episode 8: Babes in the Wood,I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.
Greg,Episode 8: Babes in the Wood,BUT IF I'M THE LEADER... WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?
