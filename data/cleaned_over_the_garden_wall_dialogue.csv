Narrator,,"Somewhere, lost in the clouded annals of history, lies a place that few have seen—a mysterious place, called the Unknown—where long forgotten stories are revealed to those who travel through the wood..."
Greg,,"... Antelope, Guggenheim, Albert, Salami, Giggly, Jumpy, Tom, Thomas, Tambourine, Leg-Face McCullen, Artichoke, Penguin, Pete, Steve... But I think the very worst name for this frog is—"
Wirt,,"Wait, wait a second. Uh...Greg?"
Wirt,,Where—are we?
Greg,,In the woods?
Wirt,,I mean... what are we doing out here?
Greg,,We're walking home!
Wirt,,"Greg! I, I think we're lost! We, w-we should've left a trail or something."
Greg,,I can leave a trail of candy from my pants!!
Wirt,,"No. though I am lost, my wounded heart resides back home—in pieces—strewn about the graveyard of my lost love. For only—"
Wirt,,Do you hear that?
Greg,,Yeah.
Wirt,,Do you think it's some kind of deranged lunatic with an axe waiting out there in the darkness for innocent victims?  Greg!
Wirt,,"Greg, you're going to get us into trouble again!"
Greg,,We should ask him for help!
Wirt,,"No, we should not ask him for help."
Greg,,But—!
Wirt,,Shh!
Greg,,You shh!
Wirt,,You shh!
Greg,,Shhh—!!
Wirt,,Shoot. Y-You think we should've asked him for help?
Beatrice,,"Hey. Maybe I can help you. I mean, you guys are lost, right?"
Wirt,,"What, in the world is going on?!"
Greg,,"Well you're slapping yourself, and I'm answering your question, and—"
Wirt,,"No, Greg. A - a bird's brain isn't big enough for cognizant speech."
Beatrice,,"Hey, what was that?"
Wirt,,"I mean, I-I'm just saying, you're, you're weird. Like, not normal. I, I mean—  Oh my gosh, stop talking to it, Wirt..."
Beatrice,,It?
Woodsman,,What're you doing here?! Explain yourselves!!
Beatrice,,"Aaand I'll see you guys later, bye."
Wirt,,"Calm—calm down, mister! Wh-Whatever you do here is your business! W-W-We just wanna get home with all our legs and arms attached!!"
Woodsman,,"These woods are no place, for children! Don't you know the Beast is afoot here?"
Wirt,,"The Beast?  We don't know anything about that! W-We're just two lost kids, trying to get home!"
Woodsman,,"Well, welcome to the Unknown, boys. You're more lost than you realize."
Woodsman,,"I found this homestead abandoned, and repurposed its mill for my needs.  You and your brother should be safe here, while I work."
Greg,,"Candy trail, candy trail, can-dy-trail..."
Wirt,,"What, what is your—work, exactly?"
Woodsman,,"Everyone has a torch to burn,  and this here's mine. I grind the horrid Edelwood trees into oil, to keep this lantern lit.  This is my lot in life, this is my burden."
Wirt,,"This guy sounds loony. Maybe we should make a break for it, i-if we can. But he must know the woods really well, so we may need to knock him out, first. Except—that might turn out really badly, huh? Yeah, bad, bad plan, eh, forget it, bad plan."
Greg,,Okay.
Woodsman,,What're you boys whispering about?
Greg,,We were talking about runnin' away outta here.
Wirt,,Shh!!
Greg,,Shh—
Wirt,,Shh!
Greg,,Shoosh!!
Woodsman,,"Leave, if you wish. But remember: the Beast haunts these woods,  ever singiiiing, his moournful melodyyy...  —in search of lost souls, such as yourselves!"
Greg,,To help us?
Woodsman,,"No, not to help you.  I have work to do in the mill. When I'm finished, I will do what I can to guide you. If you are still here when I return."
Wirt,,"Huh. I guess—we could just leave. But, eh, I don't know...—Greg!"
Greg,,What?
Wirt,,"Do you think there really is a Beast out there?  Or, is, is that guy just messing with us?"
Greg,,Uh-huh.
Wirt,,"I mean, he could've done away with us by now, if that was his plan. And he lit that fire, that's—pretty nice."
Greg,,Yeah!
Wirt,,"I guess it's possible there's a Beast, since there was a talking bird, but..."
Greg,,Yeah!!
Wirt,,"I dunno. Sometimes I feel like I'm just like...  a boat, upon a winding river... twisting, towards an endless black sea..."
Wirt,,"Further, and further, drifting away... from where I want to be —who!—I want to be..."
Greg,,"Oh, I didn't know that. Did you know, that if you soak a raisin in grape juice, it turns into a grape?  It's a rock fact!"
Wirt,,"Augh, you're not helping at all. Why don't you go play with your frog, or something?"
Greg,,"Aw, beans! Where is that frog o' mine? Hold on there, second-brother o' mine! I'll be back soon for your plan."
Greg,,Kitty!! Kitty?? Now where did that frog named 'Kitty' go? Whup--  I tripped on my own candy trail!
Greg,,Hm?  That frog's givin' me the run-around.
Greg,,Kitty?
Greg,,Gross.
Greg,,Kitty??
Greg,,"Hmm...is that—woah!!  Oh, there you are!!"
Greg,,Wirt?  ...Kitty??
Greg,,You have beautiful eyes!!
Wirt,,Yeugh...  Greg?  Uh...?
Woodsman,,What's happening? Where's your brother?
Wirt,,Ah-enuh!
Greg,,"Oh holy moley, hot dog—!!"
Wirt,,It's the Beast!!
Woodsman,,"Stay back, boys!  This creature, which is known as——huh??"
Wirt,,"GREG, WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!!"
Greg,,"That was the plan, remember? Knock him out!"
Wirt,,"Eh—no! Ah, bad plan!!  I told you to forget that plan!!!  Ahhhhh!!!"
Greg,,"Spank, spank... spank!!"
Wirt,,Run run run run run run run!!!!
Greg,,"Caaaandyyy, camouflage!  Run run run run run run run!"
Wirt,,Greg!
Greg,,"This is amazing, huh??"
Greg,,Am I supposed to throw something?  Oh yeah!  Haha!
Wirt,,He's eating your candy?
Greg,,I wonder if he ate my whole candy trail that lead to this mill!
Wirt,,Augh!  Greg!! You lead the Beast right to us with your candy!
Wirt and Greg,,Euh...
Wirt,,"Hey,  gimme the axe; you're too little to have it anyway, I—  —we gotta, we gotta get outta here!"
Wirt,,"Uhh, G-Greg, eh, g-give him the rest of your candy!!"
Greg,,Whoops!
Greg,,"Hey Wirt, look!"
Wirt,,Greg?
Greg,,"Wirt!  He spit out that turtle, and now he's my new best friend!!  Ouhh—oh... Hey, where ya goin'??"
Greg,,Ain't that just the way...
Woodsman,,The mill is destroyed...the oil! All gone!!
Wirt,,"—But, b-but look! We, w-we got the Beast problem solved."
Woodsman,,That dog?! That is NOT the Beast!!  The Beast cannot be mollified like some farmer's pet!!!
Woodsman,,"He stalks, like the night—  —he sings like the Four Winds—  —he is the Death of Hope!! He steals their children, and, he'll... ruin..."
Wirt,,"You're always messing up, Greg."
Woodsman,,"Boy! You have it backwards! You are the elder child! You are responsible for you, and your brother's actions!!"
Wirt,,"Ah, Ahm, I-I'm sorry. Maybe I can—fix it?  I—I can't fix it."
Woodsman,,You must go.  Take your brother north. Look for a town!
Wirt,,"Yeah. Thanks.  Come on, Greg."
Woodsman,,"One last thing. Beware, the Unknown! Fear the Beast! And leave these woods!!  If you can.  It is your burden to bear!"
Wirt,,"Right, yeah—ah—got it."
Woodsman,,"And you, little one. You look after that frog; give it a proper name."
Greg,,Okay.
Greg,,"Wirt, I think I thought of a new name for our frog. I'm gonna call him, 'Wirt.'"
Wirt,,That's—gonna be really confusing.
Greg,,"No, I'm gonna call you 'Kitty.'"
Wirt,,What?  Maybe I'll start calling you 'Candy Pants.'
Greg,,"Woah, yeah!!  Good one, Wirt."
Wirt,,Thanks.
Greg,,I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to Wirt!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"It's almost morning. We should've found a town by now.  This—is the way the Woodsman told us to go, right?"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Have you listened to anything I've been saying? For the last couple of hours I've been saying—
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, that settles it——I'm gonna walk up ten feet ahead of you."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Help!
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Huh?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I'm stuck!
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I hear something!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"It's probably nothing. Hey, look.  Pottsfield, one mile.  A town! Let's go this way!"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Alright. Let's go this way.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Not—
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Hello?  Hello?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Hey, you!"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Who, me?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Yeah, you!"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oh, hello!"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],It's you again. I'm stuck. Help me out of here and I'll owe you a favor!
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Woah, I get a wish?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"No-no-no, not a wish. I'm not magical. I'll just do you a good turn."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Can you turn me into a tiger?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Uh, no—I just said I'm not magical."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],It doesn't have to be a magical tiger.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Greg, stop talking to a bush."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Okay.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Huh?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Thanks! I owe you a favor, so, um—  —you two are lost kids with no purpose in life, right?"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh-huh.
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"How about I bring you to Adelaide of the Pasture, the Good Woman of the Woods?  She can help you get home!"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oooh!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"No, no. No, no. No-no-no-no-no.  Magic, talking birds, leading us to fairy godmothers, in a mysterious—  —I'm going to Pottsfield."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Yeah! We're going to Pottsfield!  Come on!
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What about the favor?
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I'll think of my wish later.
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Ugh...
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"So, let's small talk. My name's Greg. What's yours?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Beatrice.
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],My brother's name is Wirt—
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Who cares?
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"—and, my frog's name is Wirt Jr., but that may change."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Okay, that's great.  How about you and I ditch your brother?"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Mmm, maybe later.  So is it nice being a bird?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Nope.
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oh.  —Do you like waffles?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"No, waffles make me sick. I eat——..mmmaggots..."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What?
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],How can you not eat waffles?!
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What?!
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I stepped on a pumpkin!!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],A-ha!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Civilization! See? Now—  —huh? What the?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Alright. Let's rejoin society.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Hello?  Hellooo? — Hrm. See anybody?
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Nooooo—oh!  I see you.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Yeah, I—see you too, Greg."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Hey, not to be obnoxious, but an abandoned ghost town doesn't seem like it's gonna be that useful getting you guys home."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],There's gotta be somebody.  Somewhere.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Excuse me. Anyone here?  Hello?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oh. — Sorry. Uh — I'm — looking for a ph—um.  Um, I'm sorry!"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Did you find anything?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Nope. Where's Greg?
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Do you hear that?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Huh?
The song kicks up with the first verse once they look inside the barn,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"most of the area is filled with straw, but the whole town, what looks like pumpkin-dressed, straw-armed, straw-clothed people, are celebrating. A group of the pumpkin people are dancing around a maypole with a giant pumpkin head up top in shadow. Another shot shows three other pumpkin folk shucking maize with a basket to put them. Two more pumpkin villagers peel apples from a huge pile with paring knives. In the next shot, two pumpkin people - one with a straw nest hat with eggs inside - dance in a circle with a black cat standing on its hind legs and meowing happily. Once more, one pumpkin person watches another bob for apples, but they come up with an apple in one of their eye holes before it falls out with a popping noise."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What the—?
Pilgrim Pumpkin,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oho, pardon me there.  Say, you folks ought to don your vegetables and celebrate the harvest with us."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh...  Oh!  You're wearing costumes!
Pilgrim Pumpkin,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, sure. Pumpkins can't move on their own! Can they?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Ha. No. Yeah, no."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Good thing I didn't take this off!
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"You guys find this place as creepy as I do, right?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"So, it's some kind of weird cult, where they wear vegetable costumes, and dance around a big thing.  They seem nice enough."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Okay. You're in denial. That's fine.  But I'm just saying... Something feels off about this place.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, maybe I can find someone here,  who'll give us a ride home. Greg, you stay out of trouble. Beatrice, thank you, but you can leave."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I can't leave. I'm honor-bound to help you since you guys helped me. That's the—bluebird rules.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Ah, okay."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Beatrice, would you care for this dance?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],No thanks.  No thanks—no thanks!—I said no thank you!
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Say, aren't you a little too—early?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What do you mean?
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"I mean, it doesn't seem like you're ready to join us just yet."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Join you? — Yeah, no, I'm just — passing through."
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Folks don't tend to ""pass through"" Pottsfield."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oh.  Yeah?
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Yeah. It's nice here.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Um. I'm really just looking t-to leave here,  as fast as possible."
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Eh, what, what? Leave Pottsfield? Who wants to leave Pottsfield?!"
Villagers,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Huh? — What? — He wants to leave Pottsfield.
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oh, are we leaving already?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Let's leave immediately!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I'm — just trying to get home.
Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],They're not supposed to be here. Maybe he's here to steal our crops. To ruin our party.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Or take off our pumpkin shoes!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Uh — no, I, uh —"
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, now, hold on everybody. Heh, let's not jump to any conclusions."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Woah.
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Enoch, what shall we do with them?"
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I-I'm done.
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, now,  let's see here, boys. How'd you end up in this little town of ours?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, we were trying to get home. We came into town from the woods. Ehh, we saw your farms, and your houses, and thought, ""hey, here's a normal place with normal people."""
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],And we both stepped on pumpkins!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Y-Yeah! A-And then, we heard the music from the barn, and, well—uh—h-how about we just leave?"
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Heh, now let me get this straight: you come to our town, you trample our crops—you interrupt our private engagement—and now you wanna leave?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh—yes.
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],You'll never convict!  You have no proof!
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],This one's trying to escape.
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Let me go! I don't know these clowns!
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Children... it saddens me that you don't wish to stay here with us,  particularly because I simply have to punish you for your transgressions."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I told you this place was bad news!
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"So by~ the order of the Pottsfield Chamber of Commerce,  I find you guilty of trespassing, destruction of property,   disturbing the peace,  and murder."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],M-Murder?!
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oho, no, not murder. But for those other crimes, I sentence you to... a few hours of manual labor."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Wait, what? Really? That's it?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Ha-ha!  Just a few hours of manual labor,  and we're almost done."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"And then what are you going to do? — Just wander around, this way and that way, through the woods, forever more?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Uhh—uhh, maybe we'll just stay in Pottsfield. It's nice here!  I don't know.  I don't know."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Why do they even have you digging these holes?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Plantin' seeds, or—something..."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Maybe they're gonna bury you out there!
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Hey! Buried treasure!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Woah, really?  See, Beatrice?  What'd you find?"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],A skeleton!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],We're digging our own—  I-I-I was wrong. I was wrong all along. I-I don't know how to get us home—u-use your little feet to pick our locks!
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oho! Now you want my help?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"I don't want your help, but—"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Yes! I want your help! Beatrice, serious—"
"Gramps Villager, offscreen",Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Your time is up!
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Them holes been dug?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh... yeah...
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Splendid! Well then—
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"B-But, no."
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],No?
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh...
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Psst!
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Keep stalling!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Right. Yeah! Uh, you know, we were digging, and—there were too many rocks. You guys don't like rocks—right?"
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I don't think we do...
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"No, we don't like rocks."
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I don't think so...
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"See?  So, we were like, ""We should get rid of these rocks."""
"Pilgrim Villager, nodding",Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, that's a good idea."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Right?  Yeah, so, we were getting rid of the rocks, and—  —huh? Huh?  What?  They left me..."
Pilgrim Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"—So, what happened to the rocks?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh... the rocks.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Yeah, they—they were, um, you know—they—they—they got in the way of all the—well, the dirt, you know, and...  W-Woahh, ohohh?!"
Gramps Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Welcome back, Larry!"
Ponytails Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],He looks exactly the same!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What in the...?
Larry,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Whooooooop—woo!
"Villagers, cheering",Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Yeah, Larry! Woo! Yeah, go, Larry, look at that guy go!"
Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Edward, this one's for you!"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],They're all... skeletons!
Braids Villager,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Thanks for diggin' up the life of the party!
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Ah, what a wonderful harvest...  And what about you? You sure you wanna leave?"
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Me?  Yes.
Enoch,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Oh, well.  You'll join us someday..."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Uh...
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Psst!  Why are you still here?!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],What do you mean?! You guys left me!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oh.
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Come on!
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Oh—a-are they chasing us?
Greg and Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Nope.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I-I thought you guys—
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],You're welcome.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Thank you. — I guess we're even now, huh?  You're not honor-bound to help us out anymore."
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I wish. But you weren't actually in any danger with those weirdos.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Ohhh yeah! Then, you still have to help us get home!"
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I got it!  I wish Wirt Jr. had fingernails so he could play the guitar better.
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Soooo—yeah, I'll bring you to Adelaide. I mean, that's where I'm going anyway."
Greg,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],Why are you going to Adelaide's?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"I guess in some ways, I'm trying to get home, too."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],That's vague. What does that mean?
Beatrice,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I don't have to tell you anything.
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],"Well, I sure hope Adelaide is more helpful than that Woodsman was."
Wirt,Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[],I think his directions were... not very good.
Carriage Driver,[Mysterious classical piano plays],STOP!
Carriage Driver,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"OH, NO!"
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],SHH!
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"Greg, is there a beast out there?"
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],mmmm...
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],What about the beast?
Carriage Driver,[Mysterious classical piano plays],THE BEAST IS UPON ME!
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],I didn’t see any beast. That driver is nuts… mmm nuts…
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"WHEW! WELL, THAT'S GOOD."
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],Good?! That crazy driver is taking us way off course!
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],Really?
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"Yeah, who knows where we are by now with that guy acting all banannas-"
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"ooo, banana nut duck bread…"
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],Wooahh
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"WELL, FINALLY SOME GOOD LUCK."
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],BUT...
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],BUT IT'S CREEPY.
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],JUST GO TO THE TAVERN!
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],OKAY!
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"FINE, YEAH, I'LL DO"
Greg,[Mysterious classical piano plays],I'M HUNGRY.
Beatrice,[Mysterious classical piano plays],Go on!
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],I-IT'S STUCK.
Wirt,[Mysterious classical piano plays],"E-EXCUSE ME, THERE."
