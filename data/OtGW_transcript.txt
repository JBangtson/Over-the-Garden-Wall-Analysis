Chapter 1: The Old Grist Mill[]
[Into the Unknown plays as the visuals switch from various scenes: a toad playing the opening notes on a swiveling piano; a redheaded girl in a blue dress, petting her dog whilst sitting in the woods with a bird flying by in the background, and the girl—later revealed as Beatrice—looking back toward the bird; a grinning black cat on a turkey-drawn cart full of pumpkins; a circus with four long-legged instrumentalists, a juggling gorilla, and a ballerina dancing atop a galloping horse; a set of varied, wooden dolls; a nobleman—later revealed as Quincy Endicott—holding a candle, looking upon a portrait before being startled by a moving shadow and the wind; an old woman—revealed later to be Adelaide—with the top half of her face cut from the shot, using a pair of embroidery scissors to snip a thread on a quilt; two jovial, sailor-looking boys sitting on the rocks that border a river, one winding up a toy steamboat before setting it on the water; a rear-view of an unknown character—later revealed to be Lorna—setting a candle down on the shelf in an ossuary; a large fish on a wooden boat in a murky river, fishing; an unknown character—later revealed as Greg—picking up a rock from the ground; and a view of a young woman, later known as the Woodsman's Daughter, stood in front of a well with the Woodsman chopping logs in the background, the young woman looking off to the side as it pans toward the forest. It cuts to the title sequence as the song turns more nostalgic, and then moves to brief shots of blurry images, later figured to be Wirt, Gregory, and Greg's frog in the lake, before the story begins.]
Narrator: [after singing] Somewhere, lost in the clouded annals of history, lies a place that few have seen—a mysterious place, called the Unknown—where long forgotten stories are revealed to those who travel through the wood...
[The scenery now fades to the forested depths of the Unknown, with Wirt and Greg walking as the latter rambles.]
Greg: ... Antelope, Guggenheim, Albert, Salami, Giggly, Jumpy, Tom, Thomas, Tambourine, Leg-Face McCullen, Artichoke, Penguin, Pete, Steve... But I think the very worst name for this frog is—
Wirt: Wait, wait a second. Uh...Greg?
[Owl hooting]
[Squirrels chittering]
Wirt: Where—are we?
Greg: In the woods?
Wirt: I mean... what are we doing out here?
Greg: We're walking home!
Wirt: [visibly distressed] Greg! I, I think we're lost! We, w-we should've left a trail or something.
Greg: [throwing candy on the ground from his pants] I can leave a trail of candy from my pants!!
Wirt: [sighs] No. though I am lost, my wounded heart resides back home—in pieces—strewn about the graveyard of my lost love. For only—
[Axe chopping in the distance]
Wirt: [gasps] Do you hear that? [starts walking toward the noise]
Greg: [following] Yeah.
[Both brothers peek around a tree.]
Wirt: [quickly, as ax cutting sounds occur off-screen] Do you think it's some kind of deranged lunatic with an axe waiting out there in the darkness for innocent victims? [Greg runs further into the woods; Wirt calls after in a hushed whisper] Greg!
[Squirrels chittering; Wirt makes a frightened sound before following after Greg]
Wirt: [whispering, annoyed] Greg, you're going to get us into trouble again! [gasps as he looks up]
[A stranger, soon known as The Woodsman, is singing incoherently while gathering Edelwood.]
Greg: [whispering] We should ask him for help!
Wirt: [whispering] No, we should not ask him for help.
Greg: But—!
Wirt: Shh!
Greg: You shh!
Wirt: You shh!
Greg: Shhh—!! [Wirt covers Greg's mouth; Greg makes muffled sounds]
[The Woodsman leaves into another area of the forest.]
Wirt: [normal volume] Shoot. Y-You think we should've asked him for help? [Greg shrugs.]
Beatrice, from atop a branch: Hey. Maybe I can help you. I mean, you guys are lost, right?
Wirt: [dumbfounded; gasps, slaps his own face a few times] What, in the world is going on?!
Greg: Well you're slapping yourself, and I'm answering your question, and—
Wirt: No, Greg. A - a bird's brain isn't big enough for cognizant speech.
Beatrice: [annoyed] Hey, what was that?
[Greg sticks a piece of candy on a black turtle and smiles as Wirt speaks]
Wirt: I mean, I-I'm just saying, you're, you're weird. Like, not normal. I, I mean— [hushed] Oh my gosh, stop talking to it, Wirt...
Beatrice: [more annoyed] It?
[Greg sticks another piece of candy on Wirt's cape]
Wirt: [stammers, then yells in surprised fear as the Woodsman discovers them]
Woodsman: [angered] What're you doing here?! Explain yourselves!!
Beatrice: [flies away] Aaand I'll see you guys later, bye.
Wirt: [voice cracks; clearly fearful] Calm—calm down, mister! Wh-Whatever you do here is your business! W-W-We just wanna get home with all our legs and arms attached!!
Woodsman: These woods are no place, for children! Don't you know the Beast is afoot here?
Wirt: The Beast? [more stammering] We don't know anything about that! W-We're just two lost kids, trying to get home!
Woodsman: Well, welcome to the Unknown, boys. You're more lost than you realize.
[After Wirt looks to the left, there's a cut to the felled Edelwood's wooden face, leaves breezing through the holes in the bark with an ominous musical sting. Fading to black, the scene changes to a shot of the Grist Mill. We cut inside the living room where the Woodsman, Wirt, and Greg take refuge.]
Woodsman: I found this homestead abandoned, and repurposed its mill for my needs. [uses a piece of flint and some steel to light a fire in the fireplace] You and your brother should be safe here, while I work.
Greg: [setting pieces of candy on the floor while moving backwards] Candy trail, candy trail, can-dy-trail... [keeps chanting]
Wirt: [slightly nervous and suspicious] What, what is your—work, exactly?
Woodsman: Everyone has a torch to burn, [pats the lantern by his side] and this here's mine. I grind the horrid Edelwood trees into oil, to keep this lantern lit. [breaks an Edelwood branch, throws it aside; it clatters under the chaise lounge as he continues] This is my lot in life, this is my burden. 
Wirt: [after a small pause, hushed, to Greg] This guy sounds loony. Maybe we should make a break for it, i-if we can. But he must know the woods really well, so we may need to knock him out, first. Except—that might turn out really badly, huh? Yeah, bad, bad plan, eh, forget it, bad plan.
Greg: [normal volume] Okay.
Woodsman: What're you boys whispering about?
Greg: We were talking about runnin' away outta here.
Wirt: Shh!!
Greg: Shh—
Wirt: Shh!
Greg: Shoosh!!
Woodsman: [groans with effort as he stands] Leave, if you wish. But remember: the Beast haunts these woods, [almost melodically] ever singiiiing, his moournful melodyyy... [suddenly more urgent] —in search of lost souls, such as yourselves!
Greg: To help us?
Woodsman: No, not to help you. [turns away] I have work to do in the mill. When I'm finished, I will do what I can to guide you. If you are still here when I return. [Exits the living room into the mill]
Wirt: [pauses; then, thoughtfully] Huh. I guess—we could just leave. But, eh, I don't know...—Greg!
Greg: [not paying attention, he swings a log] What?
Wirt: Do you think there really is a Beast out there? [as he talks, Greg tosses the log aside, walks over to a decorative bird sculpture, and swings it] Or, is, is that guy just messing with us?
Greg: [distractedly] Uh-huh.
Wirt: I mean, he could've done away with us by now, if that was his plan. And he lit that fire, that's—pretty nice. [gesturing to the fireplace, he walks to the chaise lounge]
Greg: Yeah!
Wirt: I guess it's possible there's a Beast, since there was a talking bird, but... [sitting on the chaise lounge]
Greg: [trying to 'hype Wirt up'] Yeah!!
Wirt: [sighs as he lays back] I dunno. Sometimes I feel like I'm just like... [melodramatically, almost trance-like] a boat, upon a winding river... twisting, towards an endless black sea...
[Greg grunts as he swings what looks to be a banjo]
Wirt: [still melodramatic] Further, and further, drifting away... from where I want to be [turns to his side, facing Greg, emphatically gesturing]—who!—I want to be...
Greg: [unaffected, sitting on the floor] Oh, I didn't know that. Did you know, that if you soak a raisin in grape juice, it turns into a grape? [takes a rock out of his satchel, happily] It's a rock fact!
Wirt: [dejected] Augh, you're not helping at all. Why don't you go play with your frog, or something?
Greg: [realization] Aw, beans! Where is that frog o' mine? Hold on there, second-brother o' mine! I'll be back soon for your plan. [throws some more candy into the air before exiting the building while Wirt stares at the ceiling]
[cuts to Greg outside the mill]
Greg: [hums] Kitty!! Kitty?? Now where did that frog named 'Kitty' go? Whup-- [trips on his own candy; still joyful voice] I tripped on my own candy trail!
[Animalistic growling in the distance, towards the darkened forest.]
Greg: Hm? [walks a bit toward the noise with a pause. Then, a ribbit sound comes from the mill; Greg looks back, smiling] That frog's givin' me the run-around. [walks back, throwing candy around carelessly]
[Greg grunts some as he shimmies on top of a barrel just in front of a window on the mill; he peeks inside.]
Greg: Kitty?
[From Greg's view inside the mill, The Woodsman hums indistinctly as he grinds branches of Edelwood into oil, that of which he bottles for use.]
Greg: Gross. 
[Ribbit.]
Greg: Kitty??
[More growling from the woods]
Greg: [thoughtful; takes a step toward the noise] Hmm...is that—woah!! [falls into the barrel, on top of his frog] Oh, there you are!! [the frog ribbits]
[Growling continues, growing closer over the course of a few seconds of pause.]
Greg: [concerned, somewhat fearful] Wirt? [pause, silence; eyebrows furrow in confusion] ...Kitty??
[A dog with piercing eyes peeks into the barrel and continues its growling.]
Greg: [scared] You have beautiful eyes!!
[screeching sounds as the dog unhinges its jaw, then hard cut to inside the grist mill's living room, where Wirt plays with a bolero toy, frustrated that he can't solve it.]
Wirt: Yeugh... [creaking and the sound of wood breaking from outside startle him; wariness shows in his voice] Greg? [pause] Uh...?
[A clattering sound from the next room; harried footsteps, and the Woodsman enters.]
Woodsman: [urgent] What's happening? Where's your brother?
Wirt: [shrugging, makes the 'I dunno' sound:] Ah-enuh!
Greg: [dazed, stumbling into the mill with barrel pieces on him] Oh holy moley, hot dog—!! [Greg is knocked back to a flight of stairs by the dog's entrance]
Wirt: [startled] It's the Beast!!
Woodsman: Stay back, boys! [Greg, wielding a piece of wood, starts down the steps as the Woodsman speaks] This creature, which is known as—[Greg knocks the hat off the Woodsman's head]—huh?? [The Woodsman stumbles, steps and breaks the ceramic bird sculpture on the floor, and falls unconscious on a log.]
Wirt: [disbelief in his voice] GREG, WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!!
Greg: That was the plan, remember? Knock him out!
Wirt: Eh—no! Ah, bad plan!! [the dog stalks toward Wirt, who uses the fireplace gate as a shield] I told you to forget that plan!!! [cowers] Ahhhhh!!!
Greg: [spanks the dog with the handle of the Woodsman's axe] Spank, spank... spank!!
Wirt: [runs to the mill portion of the building while the dog's distracted, voice frantic] Run run run run run run run!!!!
Greg: Caaaandyyy, camouflage! [throws candy in the air, grabs his frog, and follows Wirt] Run run run run run run run!
[The oil-covered dog follows, breaking through the mill door, and gets stuck under a gear while pursuing Wirt.]
Wirt: [climbing the stairs, yelling] Greg! 
Greg: [comes into the frame] This is amazing, huh??
[The dog comes free; Wirt spots a sack of potatoes nearby, and throws a few at the dog before tossing the entire sack at it.]
Greg: Am I supposed to throw something? [the dog makes a loud, screech-yell-like noise] Oh yeah! [throws candy from his pants] Haha! 
[The dog eats the sweets.]
Wirt: [slight surprise] He's eating your candy?
Greg: I wonder if he ate my whole candy trail that lead to this mill!
Wirt: [angry realization] Augh! [smacks Greg's teapot hat] Greg!! You lead the Beast right to us with your candy!
[The dog flips over the platform Wirt and Greg stood on; the toppled platform separates Wirt and Greg from the dog]
Wirt and Greg: [dazed, sitting up] Euh...
Wirt: [realization] Hey, [takes the axe] gimme the axe; you're too little to have it anyway, I— [cuts quickly to the dog scratching at the wooden platform; back to Wirt, who's distressed and stammering] —we gotta, we gotta get outta here!
[Greg pats Wirt's elbow and points toward a ladder, which the brothers use to reach the roof of the mill; the dog bursts through the roof in pursuit.]
Wirt: [scared yell as he backs away] Uhh, G-Greg, eh, g-give him the rest of your candy!!
Greg: [searches his pants, but no candy remains; he spots the piece he put on Wirt's cape earlier, and throws it off the roof to the waterwheel] Whoops!
[The dog jumps off after it, and spits out a black turtle from the force of the waterwheel on its body; the whole mill falls apart, and Wirt and Greg fall into the river nearby. Wirt surfaces, and reaches land with the ax in hand. He watches the regurgitated turtle walk away with the candy still stuck to its shell.]
Greg: [offscreen] Hey Wirt, look!
Wirt: [looking around] Greg?
Greg: Wirt! [cuts to Greg and his frog atop the dog, who is now tame] He spit out that turtle, and now he's my new best friend!! [the dog shakes the water, Greg, and Greg's frog, off itself] Ouhh—oh... Hey, where ya goin'??
[The dog ambles off.]
Greg: [play-wistful] Ain't that just the way...
Woodsman: [anguished] The mill is destroyed...the oil! All gone!!
Wirt: —But, b-but look! We, w-we got the Beast problem solved. [points to the dog, who now lays asleep on the grass] 
Woodsman: [furious] That dog?! That is NOT the Beast!! [takes his axe from Wirt, who's distraught and puts his hands to his gaping mouth silently] The Beast cannot be mollified like some farmer's pet!!! 
Woodsman: He stalks, like the night— [swings his axe through a nearby rock] —he sings like the Four Winds— [wind howling] —he is the Death of Hope!! He steals their children, and, he'll... ruin... [mumbles]
Wirt: [hushed, angered; knocks Greg's teapot hat] You're always messing up, Greg.
Woodsman: Boy! You have it backwards! You are the elder child! You are responsible for you, and your brother's actions!!
Wirt: Ah, Ahm, I-I'm sorry. Maybe I can—fix it? [to himself] I—I can't fix it.
Woodsman: [forlornly, shakes his head] You must go. [points across the river] Take your brother north. Look for a town!
Wirt: Yeah. Thanks. [leads Greg by the hand north] Come on, Greg.
[As they hop over the stones across the river, the Woodsman gives a final warning:]
Woodsman: One last thing. Beware, the Unknown! Fear the Beast! And leave these woods!! [quieter] If you can. [louder again] It is your burden to bear!
Wirt: Right, yeah—ah—got it.
Woodsman: [more gentle] And you, little one. You look after that frog; give it a proper name.
Greg: [the frog ribbits] Okay. [gives an OK hand sign]
[Wirt and Greg cross the river and the scene pans up, then transitions to the brothers walking through the moonlit forest as a more lighthearted string melody backs them.]
Greg: Wirt, I think I thought of a new name for our frog. I'm gonna call him, 'Wirt.'
Wirt: That's—gonna be really confusing.
Greg: No, I'm gonna call you 'Kitty.'
Wirt: What? [playful] Maybe I'll start calling you 'Candy Pants.'
Greg: [ecstatic] Woah, yeah!! ['Wirt' ribbits] Good one, Wirt.
Wirt: Thanks.
Greg: I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to Wirt!
[As the scene fades to black, the musical backing ends on an uneasy, sour tone...]

Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee[]
[Text reading 'Cartoon Network Presents' appears, backed by a swelling, nostalgic string arrangement, the theme of the show: Over the Garden Wall's title card fades in, which then fades to the title card for Chapter 2: Hard Times at the Huskin' Bee. Its icon is a pumpkin with dot eyes and teeth smiling from a bed of vines. As the card fades to black, a train horn is distantly heard.
Another, more pastoral string theme plays as the scene fades in to the wind blowing through a branch of yellow leaves. One browner leaf gets swept away, and the wind carries it through a whole forest of rounded, yellow trees in the morning mist. The next shot cuts to the morning sky as a flock of geese, flying in a V formation, sound their honks distantly. Our third shot is close to the ground; a cricket lay on a yellowed leaf speckled with morning dew. The cricket sounds its song and hops to the left. For the fourth shot, the camera is in a thicket, watching three turkeys bob, yelp, purr and cluck, and travel across the screen from afar. One turkey stops to peck at the ground.
Then finally, in the thick of the woods come Wirt, Greg, and Greg's frog. All three of them come into view through the mist, and Greg is blowing raspberries by pushing both of his cheeks with his pointer fingers while Wirt looks anywhere but at Greg. Greg's frog rests on Greg's teapot hat, looking down at him.]
Wirt: [worried] It's almost morning. We should've found a town by now. [looks to Greg] This—is the way the Woodsman told us to go, right?
Greg: [pauses raspberries] Have you listened to anything I've been saying? For the last couple of hours I've been saying— [continues raspberries three times]
Wirt: Well, that settles it—[Greg stops, and Wirt walks ahead out of frame]—I'm gonna walk up ten feet ahead of you.
Beatrice, offscreen: Help!
Greg: [turns] Huh? [looks offscreen opposite Wirt's walking]
Beatrice, offscreen: I'm stuck!
Greg: [urgent] I hear something!
Wirt: [distracted, approaching a sign] It's probably nothing. Hey, look. [squats at the sign; it says,] Pottsfield, one mile. [excited] A town! Let's go this way!
Greg: [unaffected] Alright. Let's go this way. [goes the opposite direction]
Wirt: [annoyed] Not— [groans quietly]
[Greg, continuing ahead, approaches a bush.]
Greg: Hello? [turns] Hello?
Beatrice, offscreen: [rustling in the bush; urgently, in a low voice] Hey, you!
Greg: [at normal volume] Who, me?
Beatrice, from within the bush: Yeah, you!
Greg: [approaches the bush and peeks inside to see Beatrice tangled in vines, struggling] Oh, hello!
Beatrice: [gasps] It's you again. I'm stuck. Help me out of here and I'll owe you a favor!
Greg: [excited] Woah, I get a wish?
Beatrice: [quickly] No-no-no, not a wish. I'm not magical. I'll just do you a good turn.
Greg: Can you turn me into a tiger?
Beatrice: [annoyed] Uh, no—I just said I'm not magical.
Greg: It doesn't have to be a magical tiger.
[Wirt approaches and it cuts to both him and Greg, outside the bush.]
Wirt: Greg, stop talking to a bush.
Greg: Okay. [he proceeds to free Beatrice from the bush one-handed, who flies above them.]
Wirt: [confused] Huh?
Beatrice: Thanks! I owe you a favor, so, um— [the camera shows Wirt's surprised expression for a moment; then with a quick tone:] —you two are lost kids with no purpose in life, right?
Greg: Uh-huh.
[Wirt silently gives an annoyed, hurt expression.]
Beatrice: [with a flourish, like she's telling a story] How about I bring you to Adelaide of the Pasture, the Good Woman of the Woods? [Wirt's surprised face is shown] She can help you get home!
Greg: [enchanted] Oooh!
Wirt: [shaking his hands] No, no. No, no. No-no-no-no-no. [incredulous, gesturing about] Magic, talking birds, leading us to fairy godmothers, in a mysterious— [his eyes move around a bit before he says, mentally drained:] —I'm going to Pottsfield.
[Wirt turns to leave for Pottsfield. Greg looks to Beatrice before following.]
Greg: [jovial] Yeah! We're going to Pottsfield! [waves Beatrice over] Come on!
Beatrice: [impatient] What about the favor?
Greg: I'll think of my wish later.
Beatrice: Ugh...
[Beatrice follows them to Pottsfield. The scene cuts to all four of them—Wirt, Greg, Greg's frog who's under Greg's arm, and Beatrice—walking on a worn trail through what appears to be a pumpkin patch. Morning mist still wafts through the scene. The camera focuses on Greg, his frog, and Beatrice.]
Greg: [to Beatrice] So, let's small talk. My name's Greg. What's yours?
Beatrice: [impatient] Beatrice.
Greg: My brother's name is Wirt—
Beatrice: Who cares?
[Cut momentarily to Wirt, who looks annoyed, but says nothing.]
Greg: [rubbing his frog's face] —and, my frog's name is Wirt Jr., but that may change.
Beatrice: [dismissive] Okay, that's great. [conspiring whisper] How about you and I ditch your brother?
Greg: [grimacing] Mmm, maybe later. [changes the subject] So is it nice being a bird?
Beatrice: [blunt] Nope.
Greg: Oh. [pauses, making a face as he thinks of something to say] —Do you like waffles?
Beatrice: No, waffles make me sick. I eat—[hesitates]—..mmmaggots...
Greg: [screams]
Beatrice: [flying flip, distressed] What?
Greg: [incredulous] How can you not eat waffles?!
[Squashing sound.]
Greg: [louder scream]
Beatrice: [another flying flip, more distressed] What?!
Greg: [same tone] I stepped on a pumpkin!!
Wirt, offscreen: A-ha!
[Wirt stands with his arms up, triumphant, facing their view of the path leading straight to a rural farming village.]
Wirt: [relieved] Civilization! See? Now— [squashing sound] —huh? What the?
[It is revealed Wirt also stepped on a pumpkin. He shakes his leg back and forth with a couple sounds of effort and the pumpkin falls away to hit the ground, breaking apart with a squelching crash. Wirt turns back to the town, hands on his hips.]
Wirt: Alright. Let's rejoin society.
[The group approach the town, Greg's foot still stuck in a pumpkin, walking through the dirt-trodden road as the same pastoral string theme from the opening shots plays, but an uncertain note ends the first melody. Wirt leading the group, he walks down an alley between a house and a log cabin.]
Wirt: [uncertain] Hello? [looks around] Hellooo? — Hrm. See anybody?
Greg: [looking around] Nooooo—oh! [looks to Wirt] I see you.
Wirt: [looks to Greg, still worried] Yeah, I—see you too, Greg.
Beatrice: [impatient, annoyed and hurried] Hey, not to be obnoxious, but an abandoned ghost town doesn't seem like it's gonna be that useful getting you guys home.
[Wirt gives a silent, indignant look to Beatrice, then clears his throat and walks stage left off-screen to another house, which we cut to.]
Wirt: There's gotta be somebody. [approaches the front door, left ajar] Somewhere.
Wirt: [knocks three times] Excuse me. Anyone here? [he slowly pulls the door open and it creaks] Hello?
[Inside the house is a sitting area. On the gingham-clothed table is a turkey with its head down. The turkey lifts its head with a fleshy noise.]
Wirt: [awkwardly] Oh. — Sorry. Uh — I'm — looking for a ph—um. [the turkey blinks and Wirt's voice gets more awkward] Um, I'm sorry! [nervous laughter]
[Wirt leaves the door ajar and the turkey, once he's gone, drops its head back on the table. Returning to the alley, Beatrice is on the hay pile behind the log cabin, and next to that hay pile is Greg's frog.]
Beatrice: Did you find anything?
Wirt: Nope. Where's Greg?
[Suddenly, Greg pops out of the hay pile.]
Greg: Do you hear that?
Wirt: Huh?
[A vocal chanting melody, Pottsfield CM, starts up in the background from a barn down the road. The brothers gasp to each other, and the group all approach the barn with a couple more 'huh?'s.
The song kicks up with the first verse once they look inside the barn: most of the area is filled with straw, but the whole town, what looks like pumpkin-dressed, straw-armed, straw-clothed people, are celebrating. A group of the pumpkin people are dancing around a maypole with a giant pumpkin head up top in shadow. Another shot shows three other pumpkin folk shucking maize with a basket to put them. Two more pumpkin villagers peel apples from a huge pile with paring knives. In the next shot, two pumpkin people - one with a straw nest hat with eggs inside - dance in a circle with a black cat standing on its hind legs and meowing happily. Once more, one pumpkin person watches another bob for apples, but they come up with an apple in one of their eye holes before it falls out with a popping noise.
It cuts back to the group as just one more pumpkin villager approaches from behind.]
Wirt: [taken aback] What the—?
[The villager, named Pilgrim Pumpkin for his pilgrim hat in this wiki transcription for convenience, lightly shoves his way through the group to enter the barn. Of note is all the villagers speak muffled from behind their vegetable costumes.]
Pilgrim Pumpkin: Oho, pardon me there. [turns back to the group] Say, you folks ought to don your vegetables and celebrate the harvest with us.
Wirt: [confused] Uh... [realization] Oh! [relieved chuckling] You're wearing costumes!
Pilgrim Pumpkin: Well, sure. Pumpkins can't move on their own! Can they? [ominous hollow noise as he moves away]
Wirt: [rubbing his neck] Ha. No. Yeah, no.
Greg: Good thing I didn't take this off! [shakes his foot with the pumpkin stuck on it]
Beatrice, sitting on Greg's teapot hat: [wary] You guys find this place as creepy as I do, right?
Wirt: [hesitant, shrugging] So, it's some kind of weird cult, where they wear vegetable costumes, and dance around a big thing. [unsure] They seem nice enough.
Beatrice: Okay. You're in denial. That's fine. [suspicious] But I'm just saying... Something feels off about this place.
[The camera cuts to one pumpkin person carving a jack-o'-lantern with a similar face carved into it as the pumpkin on their own head. There's a creaking sound as their head turns to the camera before it comes back to Wirt and the group.]
Wirt: Well, maybe I can find someone here, [shrugs] who'll give us a ride home. Greg, you stay out of trouble. Beatrice, thank you, but you can leave. [waves her off]
Beatrice: [irritated sigh] I can't leave. I'm honor-bound to help you since you guys helped me. That's the—bluebird rules.
Wirt: Ah, okay. [walks off-screen]
Greg: [fake-posh voice] Beatrice, would you care for this dance?
[Greg approaches the 'dance-floor.']
Beatrice: No thanks. [more hurried] No thanks—no thanks!—I said no thank you!
[The camera cuts to the top of the maypole where the large pumpkin head looking thing shifts in the shadow with the sound of an ominous breeze to couple it. Then, the camera goes to Wirt, who approaches and pretends to not pay attention to a pumpkin villager who, in this transcription, will be named Ponytails Villager, on account of their ponytails. While he looks away, Ponytails Villager looks at him.]
Ponytails Villager: Say, aren't you a little too—early?
Wirt: What do you mean?
Ponytails Villager: [tilts head] I mean, it doesn't seem like you're ready to join us just yet.
Wirt: [suspicious confusion] Join you? — Yeah, no, I'm just — passing through.
[The camera closes in, turning, on Ponytails Villager.]
Ponytails Villager: Folks don't tend to "pass through" Pottsfield.
Wirt: [unnerved but trying to hide it] Oh. [strained smile] Yeah?
Ponytails Villager: Yeah. It's nice here.
Wirt: Um. I'm really just looking t-to leave here, [pulls on cape collar] as fast as possible.
[The camera pans stage right to an older-looking pumpkin person holding a cornucopia shell up to their 'ear'. For this transcription, they will be named Gramps Villager.]
Gramps Villager: Eh, what, what? Leave Pottsfield? Who wants to leave Pottsfield?!
[The backing music stops as the pumpkin-dressed villagers turn to the noise.]
Villagers: [hushed whispering] Huh? — What? — He wants to leave Pottsfield.
Greg: [oblivious] Oh, are we leaving already?
Beatrice, flying: [distressed] Let's leave immediately!
[Raspy breathing as a villager closes the barn doors. More suspicious whispering by the other villagers.]
Wirt, backing away: I'm — just trying to get home.
Villager: [suspicious] They're not supposed to be here. Maybe he's here to steal our crops. To ruin our party.
Greg, joining Wirt: [happy] Or take off our pumpkin shoes!
Wirt: [nervous chuckle] Uh — no, I, uh —
[There's a deep chuckle from above, and Wirt's nervous smile falls as he looks up in shock. The maypole and its pumpkin head, Enoch, starts talking, and lowers his pumpkin face to look at the group as he talks.]
Enoch: [friendly] Well, now, hold on everybody. Heh, let's not jump to any conclusions.
Greg: [surprised] Woah.
Gramps Villager: Enoch, what shall we do with them?
Beatrice, taking off: I-I'm done.
Enoch: [sharp inhale, still friendly] Well, now, [detaches some hay strands to gesture like hands] let's see here, boys. How'd you end up in this little town of ours?
[Wirt backs up a few more paces despite them being completely surrounded.]
Wirt: [haltingly] Well, we were trying to get home. We came into town from the woods. Ehh, we saw your farms, and your houses, and thought, "hey, here's a normal place with normal people."
Greg: [cutting in happily] And we both stepped on pumpkins!
Wirt: Y-Yeah! A-And then, we heard the music from the barn, and, well—uh—h-how about we just leave?
Enoch: [chuckle, his friendliness becomes passive-aggressive] Heh, now let me get this straight: you come to our town, you trample our crops—you interrupt our private engagement—and now you wanna leave?
Wirt: Uh—yes.
Greg: You'll never convict! [stomps his pumpkin foot] You have no proof!
[Gramps Villager brings a struggling Beatrice forward.]
Gramps Villager: This one's trying to escape.
Beatrice: [protesting] Let me go! I don't know these clowns!
Enoch: Children... it saddens me that you don't wish to stay here with us, [menacing, hay tendrils moving ominously] particularly because I simply have to punish you for your transgressions.
Beatrice: I told you this place was bad news!
Enoch: [singsong voice] So by~ the order of the Pottsfield Chamber of Commerce, [deeper voice] I find you guilty of trespassing, destruction of property,  [lurches to face-level with the group] disturbing the peace, [leans closer, ominous] and murder.
Wirt: [incredulous] M-Murder?!
Enoch: [leans back, lighthearted] Oho, no, not murder. But for those other crimes, I sentence you to... a few hours of manual labor.
Wirt: Wait, what? Really? That's it?
[Cut to a montage set to a shortened version of Patient is the Night. 
For the first shot, we see the main group all have a ball-and-chain for their manual labor (save for Greg's Frog). Beatrice is trying to drag herself away from hers to be free, while Greg happily balances his frog on a rake. Wirt, with gloves, gathers straw into small piles with a pitchfork, and Beatrice looks over in annoyance.
The second shot, the sky starts to get a little cloudy as Greg carries his frog over by a garden shed in the middle of the pumpkin patch. Wirt follows, then approaches one of the pumpkins with a pair of gardening shears, gloveless. He snips the pumpkin free by the stem and picks it up, before we cut suddenly to a clearing in a field of corn. There sits a turkey-drawn cart full of pumpkins, Greg's frog hanging over one side, arms dangling, and Beatrice laying on her back, wings splayed, seemingly giving up on breaking free for the moment. As Wirt leans an arm against one of the two turkeys attached to the cart, Gregory approaches the back with a pumpkin to load into the cart. Wirt wipes some sweat off his brow. Then, one of the turkeys swipes his hat, causing him to try and diver for it repeatedly while the turkeys gaggle, the thief of his hat wearing it proudly. Greg and Beatrice look, but Beatrice looks back with suspicion as a group of villagers pop their heads ominously over the stalks of corn to spy on their work.
In the next shot, the four are working in the corn field proper now, picking ears of corn to set in baskets. Greg's Frog sits and looks back with worry for some reason. Beatrice watches, as well. Wirt, picking an ear, almost goes to bite it, but spots a villager spying on him only a few feet away and decides to set it in his basket instead. Greg happily pulls down a stalk to pluck each corn ear off of it, tossing it in his basket with his frog happily watching, and then finally letting the stalk fly back up to hit Wirt in the face and knock him over. Wirt lands on the ground next to Beatrice, who gives him a disapproving look—he returns the look in kind. 
The short montage closes out with the sky at its cloudiest, casting shadow on a villager wearing a scarf and holding a white flag in the outskirts of the patch. Wind blows through both the flag and the scarf ominously as the song ends.
After the song, the boys are seen in an empty stretch of barren land bordering the fields. They're digging deep ditches with Greg's frog by Greg, and Beatrice by Wirt.]
Wirt: [grunts as he digs, relieved] Ha-ha! [to Beatrice] Just a few hours of manual labor, [wipes his forehead] and we're almost done.
Beatrice: And then what are you going to do? — Just wander around, this way and that way, through the woods, forever more?
Wirt: Uhh—uhh, maybe we'll just stay in Pottsfield. It's nice here! [unsure chuckle, sigh] I don't know. [more defensive] I don't know.
Beatrice: [suspicious] Why do they even have you digging these holes?
Wirt: [unsure] Plantin' seeds, or—something...
Beatrice: [gasp, fake delight] Maybe they're gonna bury you out there!
[Wirt blows a disbelieving raspberry.]
Greg: [excited] Hey! Buried treasure!
Wirt: Woah, really? [smug] See, Beatrice? [to Greg] What'd you find?
Greg, crawling out of his ditch: [excited] A skeleton!
[Background music becomes an eerie carnival organ. Wirt exclaims in surprise, Beatrice looks amusedly.]
Wirt: [shocked realization] We're digging our own— [gasps; to Beatrice, anxious] I-I-I was wrong. I was wrong all along. I-I don't know how to get us home—u-use your little feet to pick our locks!
Beatrice: [smug] Oho! Now you want my help?
Wirt: [annoyed] I don't want your help, but—
[The music turns to a funeral jazz march, like that performed in New Orleans, with a trumpet, snare drum. Wirt looks up to see a procession past the field with four white flags, Enoch manning the parade tied up to the frontmost flags.]
Wirt: [desperate] Yes! I want your help! Beatrice, serious—
Gramps Villager, offscreen: Your time is up!
[Suddenly, every villager is here looking down at the boys. Wirt yells in surprise! The funeral march music continues, revealing Enoch as he looks down at them all.]
Gramps Villager: Them holes been dug?
Wirt: [nervous] Uh... yeah...
Gramps Villager: Splendid! Well then—
Wirt: [panicking] B-But, no.
Gramps Villager: [ominous] No?
Wirt: Uh...
Beatrice, offscreen: Psst!
[Wirt looks down. Beatrice is using a tiny, bird-sized shovel to bang against her ball-and-chain with her beak.]
Beatrice: [hushed] Keep stalling!
Wirt: [nervous but trying to hide it, gesturing] Right. Yeah! Uh, you know, we were digging, and—there were too many rocks. You guys don't like rocks—right?
[Villagers murmur over one another.]
Ponytails Villager: [hushed] I don't think we do...
Gramps Villager: No, we don't like rocks.
Ponytails Villager: [hushed] I don't think so...
[Beatrice, freed from her ball-and-chain, hurries over to Greg's ditch to free him.]
Wirt: [grimace-smile] See? [distractedly looking at Greg] So, we were like, "We should get rid of these rocks."
[More Villager commentary.]
Pilgrim Villager, nodding: [hushed] Well, that's a good idea.
[As Wirt talks, Beatrice frees Greg, and they, along with Greg's Frog, run away.]
Wirt: Right? [nervous chuckle] Yeah, so, we were getting rid of the rocks, and— [notices Beatrice and Greg running] —huh? Huh? [under his breath] What? [shocked] They left me...
Pilgrim Villager: —So, what happened to the rocks?
Wirt: [hesitating] Uh... the rocks. 
[As Wirt flounders in his lie, a skeleton climbs out of the ditch Greg dug with two femurs in each hand.]
Wirt: Yeah, they—they were, um, you know—they—they—they got in the way of all the—well, the dirt, you know, and... [eyes widen, he turns back to see the skeleton bonking the femurs against its skull rhythmically; frightened] W-Woahh, ohohh?!
[The background music turns to a happy tune. Wirt stares dumbfounded at the skeleton, while the villagers greet the skeleton warmly and crowd around it.]
Gramps Villager: [happy] Welcome back, Larry!
Ponytails Villager: [relieved] He looks exactly the same!
Wirt: [under his breath] What in the...?
[The skeleton makes a show of putting a jack-o'-lantern over its skull, then jumps into a gourd for the torso and sticks its limbs out.]
Larry: Whooooooop—woo! [grunts as he dons the gourds]
Villagers, cheering: Yeah, Larry! Woo! Yeah, go, Larry, look at that guy go!
[Another skeleton climbs out of the ditch Wirt dug while he's still inside.]
Wirt, moving out of the way: [screams in fear and surprise]
[The skeleton approaches a villager, who offers a jack-o'-lantern.]
Villager: [happily] Edward, this one's for you!
Wirt: [to himself, realization] They're all... skeletons!
[A deep-voiced pumpkin villager with braids, named Braids Villager in this particular transcription, addresses Wirt.]
Braids Villager: [lighthearted] Thanks for diggin' up the life of the party!
[The villagers dance and frolic below Enoch, who sways happily.]
Enoch: Ah, what a wonderful harvest... [rumbling as he turns to address Wirt, deeper-voiced] And what about you? You sure you wanna leave?
Wirt, halfway out the ditch, lying in the dirt: Me? [hasty] Yes.
Enoch: [resigned] Oh, well. [turns away] You'll join us someday...
Wirt: Uh...
Beatrice, on the ground by the crops: Psst! [annoyed whispering] Why are you still here?!
Wirt: [defensive whispering] What do you mean?! You guys left me!
[Beatrice gestures a wing to point at her ankle. Wirt looks at his own ankle, and it's revealed the ball-and-chain was broken off of him this whole time.]
Wirt: [small voice] Oh.
Beatrice, backing away: Come on!
[Cut to the woods, where Greg and Greg's Frog are sitting on the ground moving their arms in sync up and down while Greg hums happily. Beatrice sits on Greg's teapot hat and looks back to where Wirt is hurriedly running into view.]
Wirt, hunched over and out of breath: Oh—a-are they chasing us?
Greg and Beatrice: Nope.
Wirt: [sigh of relief; then defensively] I-I thought you guys—
Beatrice: [knowing look] You're welcome.
Wirt: [pause] Thank you. — I guess we're even now, huh? [crosses arms] You're not honor-bound to help us out anymore.
Beatrice: [sighs] I wish. But you weren't actually in any danger with those weirdos.
Wirt: [happy realization] Ohhh yeah! Then, you still have to help us get home!
Greg, after thinking for a moment: [triumphant] I got it! [stands, holds up his frog] I wish Wirt Jr. had fingernails so he could play the guitar better.
[Crickets.]
Beatrice: Soooo—yeah, I'll bring you to Adelaide. I mean, that's where I'm going anyway.
Greg: Why are you going to Adelaide's?
[The group start off deeper into the forest; a similar pastoral theme to the beginning of the episode plays in the background.]
Beatrice: [wistful] I guess in some ways, I'm trying to get home, too.
Wirt: That's vague. What does that mean?
Beatrice: [dismissive] I don't have to tell you anything.
Wirt: Well, I sure hope Adelaide is more helpful than that Woodsman was.
[As they disappear into the forest, the scene changes to a field with a cluttered wooden rail fence. A brown leaf, blown by the wind, sways round and round toward the background.]
Wirt: [voiceover] I think his directions were... not very good.
[The leaf gets stuck between a vertical and a horizontal piece of wood intersecting on the fence, and the pastoral theme playing in the background has an ominous noise end the tune, and the episode.]

Chapter 3 Schooltown Follies[]
[Mysterious classical piano plays, Birds are chirping]

Greg Sings: Don't know who she is Or how she is, or when, what, why she is But as for where she is She is where we will go To Adelaide! To Adelaide! Come on, and join the Adelaide parade

Both Wirt and Beatrice: No.

Greg continues singing: Adelaide! To Adelaide! Let's go to Adelaide's house
[ Sour note plays ]

Greg: I need to fix that last part, but that's the idea. So, Beatrice, you sing the high part. Wirt, you sing the really high part.

Wirt: What? Oh.

Greg:  And --

Beatrice:  Nobody is singing anything anymore. And, Wirt, keep moving.

[Wirt stops to tie his shoes.]

Wirt: But I-I have to -- Ugh. All right.

Greg: But we have to do something fun.

Beatrice: You know, we really don't. We can just keep walking silently, you know? And -- Ugh. Wirt, let's go. Come on.

Wirt: Sorry, sorry.

Greg: But shouldn't we --

Beatrice: Greg, don't you want to be more like your brother -- just always doing what you're told...

[Wirt smirks smugly to himself at first, then realizes Beatrice is insulting him.]

Wirt: Huh?

Beatrice: ...Just a pathetic pushover who relies on others to make all his decisions?

Wirt: Hey! What? I'm not a pushover.

Beatrice: Hold on, Wirt. Let me get to my point.

Wirt: (Scoffs) Fine.

Beatrice: See, Greg? No willpower whatsoever.

Wirt: Hrmph!

Beatrice: You need to be more like that.

Greg: But that doesn't really sound that fun.

Beatrice: The world is a miserable place, Greg. Life isn't fun.

Greg: (Breathes deeply) Then I'll do what I need to do, I guess.

Beatrice: Thank you. We'll just focus on getting you guys to Adelaide's so I can wash my hands of this whole affair, and if you could pick up the pace a bit, that'd be great, okay? Okay? Hey, where's Greg?

Wirt: Oh. Uh, wandered off, I guess.

Beatrice: Cheese and crackers!

Greg: We need to do our part to make the world a better place!

Frog: [Croaks]

Greg: (Laughs) Yeah.

[Bell Tolls]

Greg: Huh? Whoa!

[Greg run towards the sound of the bell and happens upon a schoolhouse.]

[Mid-tempo ragtime music plays]

Greg: School?! (Scoffs) Not today.

Wirt: Greg! Greg! Greg?

Miss Langtree: Excuse me?

Miss Langtree: Please, take your seat, children. You're late. You know the rules -- "Once the bell has run, class has begun."

Beatrice: Oh, sorry, everybody. Sorry. No, he doesn't have a brain. He can't learn anything. Let's go, wirt. Come on. (Whistles) Here, boy.

Wirt: What? Did you say something? I can't hear you because I'm too busy doing what I'm told.

Beatrice: What? What are you -- (Sighs) no, no. Let's go.

Wirt: Oh, no. See, I'm a pushover, remember? I have to do what she tells me to do.

Beatrice: Ohh. Wirt, your brother could be in trouble somewhere.

[Greg knocks on the window Greg waves at the two: he hums hello. While humming his disapproval, Greg points to the rest of the class]

Frog: (Croaks)

Greg: (Gasps) Ha-Ha! Yeah!

[Greg runs off somewhere with his frog.]

Beatrice: (Sighs) Bluebirds have a short life span. You two are literally killing me every moment I'm forced to spend with you.

Wirt: Oh.

Miss Langtree: Young man, I will not stand for such nonsense in my classroom. I got enough nonsense from that no good, two-timing, low-down handsome man of mine. Oh, Jimmy Brown, why did you have to leave me so? And now, with my father threatening to close the school and that wild gorilla on the loose, why, Jimmy, I just have one thing to say...

[Upbeat Country Western music plays]

Miss Langtree starts to sing: "A" is for the apple that he gave to me,
But I found a worm inside.
"B" is for beloved that I call to him before he-

Beatrice: (Talking over her singing) Oof. That lady's got some baggage.

Miss Langtree: What's that? Young man, go to the dunce box.

Wirt: Oh. Sure, Okay.

Beatrice: No, No.

Wirt: Sure.

Wirt gets up from his seat and proceeds to put himself into the dunce box.

Beatrice: No, No.

[Wirt hums happily]

Beatrice: Aw.

Miss Langtree: Now, where were we? Oh, yes.
"G" is for the gentlemen I thought he was
When he first said hi,

[The song fades into the background as we cut to Greg outside the school, talking to other animals.]

Greg: So, my theory is hot dogs are not actually dogs, regardless of what they teach you in school. But you guys don't go to school, huh? I'm gonna stick with you guys.

[Water sloshes ]

Greg: Ha-ha! Hey, I got an idea. Let's play "Two old cat." do you guys know how to play "Two old cat"? It's fun. I'll show you. Here we go. Here's one old cat.

Greg brings up an old looking cat. [Meows]

The deer in the crowd picks up another, much older cat. It dons a beard and spectacles, and hold a cane. [Meows weakly]

Greg: You found another one! Wait. No. I think that cat is too old.

Very Old Cat: Rowr.

Greg: Sorry, kitty. We'll have to find another old cat. Hey, jeffrey, I think there's one behind you!

[A dark figure ambles behind a bush nearby.]

[Raspy breathing]

[Greg approaches the figure, and a gorilla jumps out from the brush.]

[ ROARS ]

Greg: GORILLA! RUN!

Gorilla: [Growls quizzically]

Miss Langtree, now on the floor and in lament, continues singing: And “Y”, yes “Y”,
Is the question that’s on my mind.
Oh why,

Beatrice: Hey, dunce. This is dreadful!

Wirt: Good. I'm glad you feel that way.

Beatrice: (Groans)

[The bell tolls]

Miss Langtree: I remember like -- huh?

Greg: (Gasps) GORILLA!

Gorilla: (Babbles)

Miss Langtree: Mealtime already? Well, come along children.

[Hot Jazz plays]

Gorilla: (Grunts)

[Greg and the animals he's with are ALL PANTING , trying to run from the gorilla]

Gorilla: (Roars)

[The Opossum hangs in the tree swinging a stick around, trying to stop the gorilla. GRUNTING The Opossum SPITS into his hands, preparing for a big swing]

Gorilla: Huh?

[The Opossum successfully lands a hit.]

Gorilla: Aah!

Greg salutes the Opossum:  Mm-Hmm.

[Slow jazzy piano plays]

Miss Langtree: We don't want to be late for mealtime. My father will be visiting today, and we'll need to be on our best behavior.

[Hot Jazz plays]

Greg: QUICK! IN HERE! (Pants) Oh, boy! Mealtime! This is way better than being chased by a gorilla.

Opossum: [Sniffs, munches, and groans]

Greg:  Aw, what's the matter? Mm. Kind of bland.

Other animal students: [Snort and sigh]

Beatrice: Hey, nobody ordered you to eat yet.

Wirt: Yeah, but... mm.

Greg: Hmm. (Hums quizzically)

Miss Langtree:  Ohh.

Greg: Hey! I know what to do! Here, Miss Langtree. Play something like this.

[Greg slams his hands on the piano]

Miss Langtree: Oh, like this?

[Pleasant mid-tempo swing music plays]

Greg:  Mm...Good enough. (Grunts)

Greg starts to sing:
Oh, potatoes and molasses
If you want some, oh, just ask us
They're warm and soft like puppies in socks
Filled with cream and candy rocks
Oh, potatoes and molasses
They're so much sweeter than algebra classes
If your stomach is grumblin' and your mouth starts a-mumblin'
There is only one thing to keep your brain from crumblin'
Oh, potatoes and molasses
If you can't see 'em, put on your glasses
They're shiny and large like a fisherman's barge
You know you've eat enough when you start seeing stars
Oh, potatoes and molasses
It's the only thing left on your task list
They're short and stout to make everyone shout
For, potatoes and molasses
For, potatoes and-

[ BLAM! An old man barges in on mealtime, seemingly angry.]

Mr. Langtree: THAT'S ENOUGH!

Miss Langtree: Father

Mr. Langtree: Is this what I've been paying for?!

Greg:  Hey, we just wanted to have a little fun.

Mr. Langtree: I didn't invest in this school for fun. I thought we were trying to do important work here, teaching animals to count and spell.

Miss Langtree: We are! Oh, please, Father, don't close the school. It won't happen again.

Mr. Langtree: I should say it won't.

Mr. Langtree begins to take the instruments from the animals: THIS...

A deer tries to blow into a trumpet, but it's taken away: PBHT!

Mr. Langtree: ...THIS...

[Meows]

Mr. Langtree: ...And this are all coming with me. Now send them to bed!

Miss Langtree: You heard Father. Off to bed with you.

[Slow wistful jazz plays]

Animal student: [Sighs]

Animal Student: [Whimpers ]

Animal student: [Sniffles]

Greg:  I just wanted to have fun, change the world, and make it a better place. But I just made everything worse.

Frog: [Croaks]

Beatrice: Okay, Wirt, I'll admit it -- you seem like a pushover, but you're not.

Wirt: Oh?

Beatrice: Deep down in your heart, you're a stubborn jerk. When are you gonna give this up?

Wirt: Maybe never. Maybe I'll never give this up.

Greg: Hmm. Yeah! Wirt's right -- never give up! Come on, Wirt. Let's go save the day.

Wirt: Okay, if you say so

Beatrice: (Scoffs)

Greg: Come on.

[Owl hoots]

Wirt: So, what's the plan, Greg?

Greg: Plan? Ohh. I don't know.

[We see Mr. Langtree curling up in the brush, using the instruments to help prop up his coat to make a tent.]

Mr. Langtree: Ohh! Who would've thought making a primer school for animals was a bad idea? My life savings, my home -- everything I had went into that dear, dear school. And now I'm forced to sell these instruments just to keep it open. All the while that loathsome Jimmy Brown is off gallivanting who knows where! Not to mention that wild gorilla on the loose. (Sighs) if only something would go right for a change. (Snoring)

Greg:  Okay, I think he's asleep. Let's go steal his stuff.

Both Wirt and Beatrice: What?

[Pastoral music plays, birds chirp]

Mr. Langtree: (Snores, groans, and gasps) The instruments! They've been stolen! Who would do such a thing?! Huh?

[ Humming, Indistinct chatter ]

Good Samaritan: Here you go.

Good Samaritan: Oh, here you go, Sonny.

Mr. Langtree: What is this?

Wirt: It's a benefit concert for the school.

Miss. Langtree: Ah, isn't it grand -- all these fine people giving out of the goodness of their hearts? (Sighs) not like my Jimmy Brown.
[Dramatic piano plays]

Beatrice: Ohh, here we go.

Miss Langtree: All he ever did was steal my heart away.

[A dark shadow looms over Miss Langtree.]

Greg: GORILLA!

Miss Langtree: AAH!

Gorilla: (Roars)

[Crowd screams]

Mr. Langtree: Young man, do something!

Wirt: Uh...

[Wirt closes his eyes and runs towards the gorilla. He shouts weakly, but then he trips over his shoelaces and tumbles into the gorilla.]

Wirt: Whoa! (Groans)

[Everyone gasps]

Jimmy: (Grunts loudly) Finally.

Miss Langtree: Jimmy?

Jimmy: That's right, Darlin'. I was the gorilla.

Miss Langtree: But why did you do it?

Jimmy: Got a job in the circus so's I could finally buy ya that wedding ring. But when I got stuck in the dang suit, everybody was too doggone scared to help me out.

Miss Langtree: Aw, Jimmy. Oh!

Jimmy: Darlin'.

[Everyone cheers]

Mr. Langtree: I guess the world really is as sweet as potatoes and molasses.

Greg starts to sing: Oh, potatoes and molasses, If you want some...

Wirt: So, want me to tell Greg it's time to get going?

Beatrice: Nah, let him have his fun.

Greg contines singing: Filled with cream and candy and rocks

Beatrice: Hey, Wirt.

Wirt: Yeah?

Beatrice: Tie your shoe.

Wirt: Hmm. Oh. Mm. Okay.

Greg sings:...algebra classes
If your stomach is grumblin' and your mouth...

Suddenly, a little frog boy rides a cockroach across the deck, knocking over the crew member's bucket, causing a spill, much the crew member's dismay.]
Cleaning frog crew member: Rawwr!! (croaks)
[On stage, the band plays according the frog conductor, as frogs in front of the stage dance to the music.

[Wirt attempts to pick up the tadpoles, but stops to continue to try and escape with Greg and company. As the constable tries to turn the corner, he trips on the tadpoles like they were banana peels. The mother frog wails as her babies thrash around the deck and she tries to pick them up.]
[Wirt and company run through the helm. Greg stops for a moment to salute the captain before he continues running. The constable and crew member also stop to salute the captain before continuing to chase after the stowaways. They run into a storage room, coming out in disguise as a single band member under a band coat plus a drum.]
[ SQUISH! SQUISH! ]
Frog Constable: Hmmmm.
Wirt: GOOD DAY, GENTLE--
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
[ Deep voice ] GOOD DAY,
GENTLEMEN.
WE -- I -- MUST BE GOING NOW TO
JOIN THE BAND.
Greg: Wirt, drum me!
Wirt: Okay.
Greg: OW! OW, OW!
OW! OW, OW!
[ POP! POP! ]
ARE WE GOOD?
Wirt: WHEW! I THINK SO.
Beatrice: WIRT, SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO
FACE YOUR PROBLEMS.
TURN YOURSELF IN AND GET KICKED
OFF THIS BOAT.
Wirt: I DON'T THINK TODAY'S A GOOD
DAY TO GET ARRESTED BY FROGS.
Beatrice: HMM. WELL...
Wirt: HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?
Greg: DON'T PUSH ME!
Wirt: OOF! OOF! OOF!
[ INSTRUMENTS WARMING UP ]
Greg: [ GRUNTS ]
Wirt: OKAY, EVERYBODY.
ACT NATURAL.
Greg: DRUM ME! DRUM ME!
Wirt: I SAID, "ACT NATURAL."
Greg: IT IS NATURAL! I'M A DRUM!
[The conductor taps his baton and begins to conduct the band; MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ]
WIRT, DRUM ME!
DRUM ME IN THE FACE!
Wirt: OKAY! OKAY! SHH!
DON'T DRAW ATTENTION TO US!
[ Wirt raises his drumstick to drum Greg, but smacks a frog band member in the face, causing the frog to fall off the stage. He stumbles into other frog passengers, getting tangled up in a waltz, bumping into a waiter, falling down some stairs and finally slipping on one of the tadpoles and falling off the boat!]
[ FROGS CROAKING ]
[ FLIES BUZZING ]
Frog Bassoon Player: WHOA!
[ HONK! ]
Frog Bassoon Player: WHOA!
Wirt: NO BASSOON PLAYER.
UH-OH.
[ FROGS CROAKING ANGRILY ]
DOG, THOSE FROGS REALLY LOVE THE
BASSOON!
[ CROAKING CONTINUES as the frogs go into an uproar over the interruption, and the constable and crew member look suspiciously at Wirt and Greg's desiguises.]
HUH?
Frog Constable: HMM.
Wirt: OH, NO.
BEATRICE, I'M TOO YOUNG TO GO TO
FROG JAIL.
Greg: HEY, WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE
BASSOON?
Wirt: THAT'LL GET US KICKED OFF
THIS BOAT FOR SURE.
Beatrice: [ GASPS ]
NO, GREG'S RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD PLAY IT.
GO AHEAD. YOU'LL DO FINE.
YOU PLAY INSTRUMENTS, RIGHT?
Wirt: YEAH, BUT BASSOON AND
CLARINET ARE WAY DIFFERENT.
I DON'T HAVE THE EMBOUCHURE FOR
BASSOON.
I MEAN, THE LOWER AND MIDDLE
RANGES HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES IN
TERMS OF --
Beatrice: WIRT, YOU CAN DO IT.
Wirt: SERIOUSLY, NOBODY WANTS TO
HEAR ME PLAY.
Beatrice: I DO!
Greg: I DO!
George Washington: [ CROAKS ]
Wirt: UH...
[ OUTRAGED CROAKING CONTINUES ]
Beatrice: WIRT?
Wirt: YEAH. HERE WE GO.
[ Wirt picks up the bassoon and Greg takes up the drumstick, drumming himself as Wirt begins to play.]
Greg: OW. OW. OW. OW.
[ MUSIC RESUMES ]
George Washington sings: AT NIGHT WHEN THE LAKE IS A
MIRROR
Frog Crewmember: HUH?
Greg: WHOA!
George Washingtong continues singing: AND THE MOON RIDES THE
WAVES TO THE SHORE
A SINGLE SOUL SETS HIS VOICE
SINGING
CONTENT TO BE SLIGHTLY
FORLORN
A SONG RISES OVER THE LILIES
Frog Crowd: WAH-OOH, WAH-OOH
George Washington:  SWEEPS HIGH TO CLEAR OVER
THE REEDS
AND OVER THE BULLRUSHES
SWAYING
TO PLUCK AT A PAIR OF
HEARTSTRINGS
Wirt: HEY, BEATRICE, THANKS FOR
SUPPORTING MY BASSOONING.
Beatrice: YEAH. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOOD.
Wirt: THE BEST PART IS WE'RE STILL
ON TRACK TO GET TO ADELAIDE'S.
Beatrice: YEP. THAT'S GREAT.
Wirt: YOU DON'T SEEM THRILLED.
Beatrice: WELL, I JUST --
I DON'T WANT YOU TO --
NEVER MIND. NEVER MIND.
George Washington: CARRIES THEIR MEMORY ON--
["George Washington" gets carried away in song and gestures his arms towards the crowd, losing his coat and revealing himself and Wirt]
[ ALL GASP ]
[George Washington becomes embarrassed by his sudden nakedness and desperately tries to cover himself.]
Frog Crewmember: [ GASPS ]
[ The constable blows his whistle ]
>> All: SHH!
Wirt: UH...
[ MUSIC RESUMES ]
George Washington: OVER THE TREETOPS AND
MOUNTAINS
OVER THE BLACKENED RAVINES
Frog Lady: OHH!
George Washington: THEN SOFTLY IT FALLS BY A
HOUSE NEAR A STREAM
AND OVER THE GARDEN WALL
TO THEE
Greg: AHH.
I KNEW YOU WERE SPECIAL.
[ STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ FROGS CROAKING ]
Wirt: WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
Beatrice: LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE...
HIBERNATING IN THE MUD.
Wirt: SO, WHERE'S ADELAIDE'S HOUSE?
IS IT CLOSE?
Beatrice: IT'S -- HMM.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST GO
TOMORROW, I THINK.
WE DON'T WANT TO BOTHER HER TOO
LATE, YOU KNOW?
Wirt: WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO --
JUST SIT AROUND IN THE MUD WITH
THESE FROGS?
Greg: [ GASPS ]
I CALL THAT MUD OVER THERE!
HA HA HA! YEAH!
Beatrice: SO, THEN WHAT?
Wirt: WELL, THEN I WENT TO GO TALK
TO SARA -- I MEAN, LIKE REALLY
TALK TO HER, YOU KNOW -- PUT ALL
MY CARDS ON THE TABLE, YOU KNOW?
Beatrice: YEAH.
BWirt: AND THEN JASON FUNDERBERKER
COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND WHISKS
HER AWAY!
UGH! JASON FUNDERBERKER --
THAT GUY.
[ GROWLS ]
PLUS GREG WAS AROUND.
HE WOULD HAVE EMBARRASSED ME
EVEN MORE.
Beatrice: WELL, WIRT, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE A REAL LOSER BACK HOME.
Wirt: OH, THANKS A LOT.
Beatrice: I MEAN COMPARED TO HOW YOU
ARE HERE.
HERE YOU'RE LIKE A HERO AND
STUFF, RIGHT?
Wirt: AM I?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D SAY,
"HERO," BUT --
Greg: DO YOU THINK THAT I COULD BE
A HERO, TOO?
HUH?
[ A group of frogs crowd around George Washington, offering him a record contract]
[ Greg GASPS ]
YOU DONE GOOD, MR. PRESIDENT.
YOU DONE GOOD.
Beatrice: IF I WAS YOU, I WOULDN'T EVEN
WANT TO GO HOME.
Wirt: YEAH, BUT I-I CAN'T STAY HERE
FOREVER.
Beatrice: WHY NOT?
Wirt: HMM? WHY NOT?
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE I-I CAN'T
JUST -- MAYBE IT IS BETTER TO
STAY HERE.
Wirt: GREAT. THEN IT'S AGREED.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADELAIDE'S.
GOOD NIGHT, WIRT.
Beatrice: OH, WHAT?
OH. GOOD NIGHT, BEATRICE.
[ It's now late into the night, and everyone seems to be fast asleep. Beatrice then takes flight into the night, waking Wirt.]
Wirt: BEATRICE.
GREG, WAKE UP!
Greg: HUH?
Wirt: BEATRICE TOOK OFF!
Greg: WHAT?
Wirt: COME ON!
Greg: MMM.
[As Greg wakes from his sleep, he notices George Washington being dressed by the captain. Greg takes a deep breath, as if preparing for a goodbye.]
Wirt: COME ON, GREG!
Greg: I'M COMING.
[ Beatrice flies through the night, arriving to a house in the middle of the woods. She enters through the chimney, tumbling out all covered in soot.]
Beatrice: [ COUGHING ]
Adelaide: CLOSE THE FLUE.
THAT FRESH AIR DOES SIMPLY
GRUESOME THINGS TO MY TENDER,
DELICATE SKIN.
Beatrice: ADELAIDE, WE NEED TO TALK.
Adelaide: DID YOU BRING ME WHAT I ASKED
FOR?
Beatrice: I FOUND TWO BROTHERS LOST IN
THE WOODS, BUT I CAN'T GIVE THEM
TO YOU, ADELAIDE.
THEY NEED TO GO HOME.
Adelaide: NONSENSE!
I'LL GIVE THEM A WONDERFUL HOME
HERE.
Beatrice: THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, BUT --
Adelaide: CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SICK AND
HELPLESS?
[ IMITATING COUGHING ]
AH-CHOO!
I'M ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD.
I WANT A CHILD SERVANT.
Beatrice: SERVANT?
I THOUGHT YOU JUST WANTED SOME
YARD WORK DONE.
Adelaide OUR ARRANGEMENT WAS FOR YOU
TO BRING ME A CHILD SERVANT AND
THEN I GIVE YOU THE SCISSORS...
TO SNIP, SNIP, SNIP YOUR
FAMILY'S WINGS AWAY TO MAKE THEM
HUMAN AGAIN.
Beatrice: WHAT IF I BECAME YOUR
SERVANT?
Adelaide: HA!
I NEED A BIG, STRONG CHILD!
Beatrice: YOU CAN TURN ME INTO A HUMAN,
CAN'T YOU?
Adelaide: OH, YES -- SCISSORS!
Beatrice: YEAH. YEAH.
SO, GIVE ME THE SCISSORS.
I'LL GO HELP MY FAMILY.
[ GASPS ] WIRT!
Adelaide: CLOSE THE DOOR!
I'LL CATCH MY DEATH OF COLD!
Wirt: WHAT'S GOING ON?
Beatrice: YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
Wirt: ADELAIDE?
Adelaide: WELCOME HOME, CHILDREN.
[Adelaide pulls some strings hanging near her, entangling Wirt and Greg]
Greg: HUH?
Wirt: HUH?
Both: AAAH!
Wirt: BEATRICE, WH-WHAT --
Beatrice: I...
Wirt: BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
FRIENDS.
Adelaide: NOW THEY'RE MINE.
AND ONCE I FILL THEIR HEADS WITH
WOOL, THEY'LL BECOME JUST LIKE
LITTLE SHEEP AND FOLLOW MY EVERY
COMMAND.
Wirt: ALL ALONG, YOU'VE BEEN
LEADING US TO THIS CRAZY LADY?
Adelaide: I DO AS HE COMMANDS -- THE
VOICE OF THE NIGHT, THE BEAST OF
ETERNAL DARKNESS.
Beatrice: [ GRUNTING ]
Adelaide: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
OHH!
THE NIGHT AIR IS POISONOUS!
Beatrice: BREATHE IT IN, LADY.
WIRT, GREG, LET'S GO!
Adelaide: THE DEADLY...AIR!
Beatrice: WHOA! GEEZ!
SHE WASN'T KIDDING!
Adelaide: IT'S FRESH!
OHHHHHH!
Beatrice: HUH?
[ HINGES CREAK ]
WIRT? GREG?
[ COUGHING ]
GREG! WIRT!
IT WASN'T WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE!
I WAS JUST -- PLEASE COME BACK!
OHH.
[ CRYING ]
Wirt: HMM.
Greg: WIRT, WHAT ABOUT BEATRICE?
Wirt: HMM. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED
ANYONE.
Frog: [ CROAKS ]
Greg: HUH?
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN!
Greg: [ CROAKS ]
Wirt: HURRY IT UP, GREG.
[ WIND BLOWING ]
Chapter 7: The Ringing of the Bell[]
[ WIND RUSHING, PASTORAL MUSIC PLAYING ]
[ THUNDER RUMBLES. A storm has started up. Beatrice looks out from Adelaide's window solemnly. We cut to Greg and Wirt walking through the storm.]
Greg: [BREATHING HEAVILY] WHAT ARE WE DOING?
Wirt: WE'RE WALKING, GREG.
Greg: BUT WHERE?
Wirt: A PLACE TO WAIT OUT THIS RAIN.
Greg: OH. BUT... [BREATHING HEAVILY] SHOULDN'T WE WAIT FOR BEATRICE?
Wirt: [ SIGHS ] I DON'T NEED BEATRICE. I-I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT ON MY OWN.
Greg: OH, THAT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU HAVE A PLAN. HEY, WIRT?
Wirt: WHAT?
Greg: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN? 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANY DETAILS, SO IT'S HARD FOR ME --
Wirt: GREG, I DO HAVE A PLAN. AND IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ME, OKAY? IF YOU WANT TO GO LOOK FOR BEATRICE, GO AHEAD. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.
Greg: ANYTHING? THAT'S A LOT OF POWER.
[ CRASH as a tree falls down]
Greg: WIRT! OH, NO! DID I KNOCK DOWN THAT TREE WITH MY POWERS? SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?
Wirt: YEAH.
THAT TREE JUST CAME AT ME OUT OF
NOWHERE.
GREG, LOOK -- AX MARKS.
SOMEONE CHOPPED IT DOWN.
Woodsman: INDEED. 'TWAS I.
Wirt: [ GASPS ]
Greg: AAH! OHH!
Woodsman: STOP! LISTEN!
THE BEAST KNOWS YOUR PRESENCE!
READY TO CLAIM YOU AS PART OF
HIS DARK FOREST, BUT ONLY IF YOU
GIVE UP!
KEEP HEARTY IN BOTH BODY AND
SPIRIT AND YOU SHALL BE SAFE
FROM HIM.
FALL ILL OR LOSE HOPE AND YOUR
LIFE SHALL PASS INTO HIS CROOKED
HANDS.
[Wirt kicks the woodsman's lantern away to distract the woodsman so he can run]
UGH! CHILDREN!
PLEASE, HEED MY WARNING!
BOYS, BEWARE THE BEAST!
The Beast: WOODSMAN.
The Woodsman: HUH?
The Beast: WE SHOULD TALK.
[ THUNDER RUMBLES ]
Greg: [ GRUNTS ]
Wirt: [ GRUNTS ]
I THINK WE LOST HIM.
Greg: HA HA! YOU GOT HIM WITH THE
OLD KICKEROO!
Wirt: SEE? I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
I DON'T NEED BEATRICE.
NOW, TO FIND SOMEPLACE TO WAIT
OUT THIS RAIN...
Greg: AS LONG AS IT'S NOT THAT OLD,
BROKEN-DOWN --
Greg: SHH!
IT'S PERFECT!
COME ON, GREG!
Greg: UH, WIRT...
AIN'T THAT JUST THE WAY?
[ FROG CROAKING ]
Wirt: THIS PLACE ISN'T SO BAD.
HUH?
Greg: MAYBE.
DUM DUM-DUM DUM-DUM DUM DUM
[ CROAKING CONTINUES ]
Greg: GET THAT FROG OUT OF YOUR
PANTS.
Greg: HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS.
HEY, WHAT'S IN THESE OLD
BASKETS?
WHOA!
Wirt: WHAT?
Greg: WE'RE RICH!
Wirt: WHAT?
Greg: LOOK!
IT'S FULL OF BLACK TURTLES!
WE'RE TURTLE RICH!
Greg: [ GROANS ]
Greg: [ CHUCKLES ]
Wirt: YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,
FINDING A BASKET OF TURTLES IN
AN ABANDONED HOUSE, HUH?
Greg: HA HA! YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
Wirt: GREG, NOT THAT KIND OF FUNNY.
Greg: HUH? OH.
Lorna: AUNTIE?
AUNTIE, I FINISHED SORTING --
[ GASPS ]
Wirt: [ GASPS ]
Lorna: WHO ARE YOU?!
Greg: WE'RE BURGLARS!
Wirt: NO, NO. NO, NO.
WE'RE -- WE'RE NOT.
WE JUST NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THE
RAIN, AND WE THOUGHT THIS PLACE
WAS ABANDONED, SO WE --
Greg: SO WE CAME HERE TO BURGLE
YOUR TURTS.
Wirt: NO, IT'S NOT TRUE.
[Wirt quickly tries to cover Greg's mouth]
Greg: IT IS TRUE! HA HA HA!!
[ Wirt wrestles Greg into the ground]
OH, OKAY. I GIVE UP.
Wirt: HA! SEE?
Lorna: I BELIEVE YOU, BUT, PLEASE
[COUGHS] HIDE YOURSELVES AT
ONCE.
AUNTIE WHISPERS IS COMING SOON.
Wirt: UH, WHAT?
[ BOTH GASP ]
[ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ]
Lorna: HIDE, QUICKLY!
WELCOME HOME, AUNTIE.
Auntie Whispers: LORNA, MY SWEET CHILD.
[ SNIFFS ]
HMM. HAS ANYONE COME HERE TODAY?
Lorna: NAY, AUNTIE -- NOT A SOUL.
Auntie Whispers: THEN NO ONE SHALL BE DEVOURED
ALIVE TONIGHT?
Lorna: NAY, I PRAY NOT, MUM.
Wirt: DEVOURED ALIVE?
Auntie Whispers: YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL, LORNA,
BUT YOU DECEIVE ME.
Lorna: I SPEAK THE TRUTH, AUNTIE.
I SWEAR.
Auntie Whispers: DECEIVE ME NOT, CHILD.
I CAN SMELL THEM.
[ SNIFFING ]
I CAN SMELL THE CHILDREN IN THIS
HOUSE.
Wirt: WHAT? CHILDREN?
I'M, LIKE, IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Greg: YEAH, WELL, YOU STILL STINK.
Wirt: SHH!
Greg: YOU "SHH."
Auntie Whispers: TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE HIDING
THEM, PRECIOUS ONE.
Lorna: I --
Auntie Whispers: THE RINGING OF THE BELL
COMMANDS YOU.
[ BELL RINGING ]
Lorna: [ GASPS ]
LOOK [GASPS] IN THE BASKET.
Auntie Whispers: YOU HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF
DOOM, CHILDREN -- YOUR DOOM.
Lorna: [ GASPS ]
Auntie Whispers: OH. MY DEAR, WHY, ALL ALONG,
YOU MEANT IT BE THE TURTLES THAT
SMELL SO RIPE.
Lorna: A-A-AYE.
THAT IS WHAT I MEANT.
Auntie Whispers: [ SNIFFS ] MM.
[ Auntie Whispers puts the turtle in her mouth, munching on it.]
THEN YOU HAVE NO EVIL SECRETS TO
KEEP?
Lorna: NAY. I HAVE NONE.
[Auntie Whispers slurps the turtle shell, discarding the now empty shell].
Auntie Whispers: THEN OFF TO BED GO I, AND
YOU, LORNA -- YOU SHALL SORT THE
BONES OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
EATEN HERE BEFORE.
Lorna: I HAVE FINISHED ALREADY.
Auntie Whispers: THEN CLEAN THIS FLOOR UNTIL
IT SHINES.
THE RINGING OF THE BELL COMMANDS
YOU.
Lorna: [ GASPS ]
YES, AUNTIE WHISPERS.
Auntie Whispers: YOU KNOW I DO THIS FOR YOU,
CHILD.
KEEPING YOU BUSY IS THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP EVIL SPIRITS FROM
DRIVING YOU TO WICKEDNESS.
Lorna: DO NOT WORRY,
AUNTIE WHISPERS.
THE WORK SHALL KEEP ME BUSY.
[ COUGHS ]
Auntie Whispers: GOOD NIGHT, MY DEAR.
AND DOWSE THAT FIRE.
I DID NOT ASK YOU TO LIGHT IT.
[ SNORING ]
Lorna: COME OUT, MY TURTLES.
SHE SLEEPS.
Greg: [ GRUNTS ]
Wirt: YOU SURE?
Lorna: AYE.
[ COUGHS ]
Wirt: UH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'VE BEEN COUGHING A LOT.
Lorna: [ COUGHS ] IT'S MY ILLNESS.
IT'S THE REASON AUNTIE WHISPERS
IS SO HARD ON ME.
Wirt: GOSH! THAT LADY IS SO BAD.
YOU SHOULD GO SEE A DOCTOR.
Lorna: AUNTIE DOES NOT ALLOW
VISITORS HERE.
SHE BELIEVES OUTSIDERS WILL LEAD
ME TO BECOME WICKED.
Wirt: YEAH. SEE?
THAT'S SUPERWEIRD.
I DON'T MEAN TO INSULT YOUR
FAMILY, BUT --
Lorna: OH, SHE'S NOT MY REAL AUNT.
Wirt: OH, MY GOSH. SEE?!
Greg: HEY, WHERE'D DR. CUCUMBER GO?
[ FROG CROAKS ]
HEY, I'M GONNA GET YOU!
Wirt: SO, YOU GOT TO KEEP SWEEPING
TILL YOU'RE DONE?
Lorna: MM-HMM.
THE WORK NEVER ENDS.
BY THE TIME THIS TASK IS
COMPLETE, SHE WILL RETURN AND
ORDER ME TO A NEW TASK, AND SO
IT GOES.
Wirt: IF I HELP AND WE GET THE WORK
DONE FAST, MAYBE YOU CAN...
[Wirt uses with his hands to create two running figures]
Lorna: ESCAPE? WITH YOU?
Wirt: YEAH.
Greg: CAN WE ESCAPE WITH YOU, TOO?
[ FROG CROAKS ]
Wirt: GREG...
Lorna: HMM. YES.
PERHAPS THIS -- THIS TIME IT
COULD BE DIFFERENT.
HERE.
[Lorna passes Wirt a cloth to clean with, accidentally touching his hands when she does.]
[ GASPS ]
[ COUGHS ]
Wirt: UH, I'LL TAKE THAT SIDE.
Lorna: Mm.
Greg: MM, SOMETHING WEIRD IS GOING
ON.
[ FROG CROAKS ]
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
[Duet plays]
Wirt: HERE WE ARE
Lorna: TWO OF US, LIKE SHIPS
Wirt: LIKE SHIPS
Both: UPON A WINDING
RIVER
Wirt: AND YET
Lorna: AND YET
Both: SOMEHOW WE FOUND EACH
OTHER
LIKE STRANGERS, YOU AND I
Greg:  HEY!
YOU CAN RUN AND YOU CAN HIDE!
PAGING DR. CUCUMBER!
YOU'RE NEEDED IN THE OPERATING
RO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-OM!
[ FROG CROAKS ]
Wirt: WELL, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.
Greg: AAAAH!
Auntie Whispers: WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE?
Greg: OOPS!
Auntie Whispers: YOU SHAN'T REMAIN ALIVE FOR
LONG IN THIS HOUSE.
Greg: AAAH!
Auntie Whispers: I'M WARNING YOU, CHILDREN --
KEEP AWAY FROM MY LORNA, OR YOU
SHALL BE HASTILY GOBBLED UP!
Wirt: WE -- WE DON'T WANT NO
TROUBLE, LADY.
LET'S JUST TALK IT OUT.
I'M WIRT.
Auntie Whispers: LORNA, COME HERE.
Lorna: UH...UH...
Auntie Whispers: THE RINGING OF THE BELL
COMMAN-- UH, WHERE --
DID I PUT THE BELL ON MY
NIGHTSTAND?
Lorna: FOLLOW ME.
Auntie Whispers: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
COME OUT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.
UNLOCK THIS DOOR.
SHE WILL DEVOUR YOU.
Wirt: WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
[From the darkness behind Wirt and Greg, Lorna breathes heavily and floats up from behind them, appearing as a ghoulish spectre!]
Lorna: [ HISSES ]
Both: AAH!
Lorna: MORE BONES TO SORT.
Both: NO!
Auntie Whispers: I TOLD YOU BOYS TO STAY AWAY
FROM HER, BUT NOW YOU'VE GONE
AND MADE HER WICKED AGAIN.
Greg: OH-HO!
FOR SOME REASON, I THOUGHT THAT
OLD LADY WAS THE PEOPLE-EATER,
BUT IT WAS LORNA ALL ALONG.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU STUFF.
NOW I HAVE A PLAN THAT'LL --
UGH!
[Wirt grabs Greg and breaks out of the room through a nearby window]
Wirt: [ GRUNTS ]
Greg: [ GRUNTS ]
HA HA! YOUR PLAN WAS BETTER.
Lorna: I'M SORRY, MY TURTLES...
Greg and Wirt: [ BREATHING HEAVILY ]
Lorna: ...BUT I MUST FEED!
[ BOTH GRUNT as they fall into a swamp ]
Wirt: GREG!
Greg: LET'S TRY MY PLAN NOW.
Lorna: [ MOANS ]
Greg: THE RINGING OF THE BELL
COMMANDS YOU.
[ BELL RINGING ]
Wirt: WHAT THE --
Greg: OH. HE ATE THE WITCH'S MAGIC
BELL WHEN WE WERE --
Wirt: FINE! DO SOMETHING.
Greg: OH. I COMMAND YOU TO...
Lorna: THE SPIRIT COMPELS ME.
Greg: ...TRANSFORM INTO A MAGICAL
TIGER.
Wirt: THE RINGING -- THE RINGING OF
THE BELL COMMANDS YOU!
STOP MAKING LORNA DO BAD STUFF,
SPIRIT!
Lorna: [ ROARS ]
Wirt: AND ALSO GO AWAY AND DON'T
COME BACK.
Lorna: [ ROARS ]
[ ZAP ]
[ THUD ]
Wirt: LORNA! LORNA!
Greg: WIRT, LOOK!
[Above Lorna, an evil spirit swirls into oblivion]
>> [ MOANING ]
[ ZAP ]
Wirt: LORNA!
Lorna: WIRT, YOU SAVED ME.
Auntie Whispers: LORNA? LORNA?
OH, MY LORNA.
Lorna: AUNTIE WHISPERS!
Auntie Whispers: I THOUGHT THEY'D STOLEN YOU
AWAY.
Lorna: NO, AUNTIE. THEY SAVED ME.
THEY BANISHED THE EVIL SPIRIT
WITH THE POWER OF THE BELL!
Greg: YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK AFTER
GREG JR. GOES TO THE BATHROOM.
Auntie Whispers: OH, LORNA [SNIFFS] THAT'S
WONDERFUL, DEAR.
Lorna: AUNTIE WHISPERS, WHAT'S
WRONG?
Auntie Whispers: WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE CURED,
YOU WON'T BE NEEDING OLD
AUNTIE WHISPERS ANY MORE TO LOOK
AFTER YOU.
Lorna: OH, AUNTIE, NO.
Auntie Whispers: OHH.
Lorna: I WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU.
YOU ARE MY FAMILY.
Auntie Whispers: AH. OHH.
Lorna: THANK YOU SO MUCH, WIRT.
Auntie Whispers: AND A BIT OF ADVICE -- BEWARE
OF MY SISTER, ADELAIDE.
SHE LIVES IN THE PASTURE.
SHE MUST NOT BE TRUSTED.
Lorna: PERHAPS I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN
SOMEDAY.
I HOPE SO.
Wirt: SMELL YOU LATER.
Greg: WOW, WIRT!
YOU SAVED THE DAY TWICE TODAY!
Wirt: YEAH, I GUESS.
BUT SO WHAT?
WE'RE STILL NOT ANY CLOSER TO
GETTING HOME.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
OUT HERE ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER GET
BACK HOME.
Greg: SURE, WE WILL!
WHAT CAN STOP US?
YOU GOT A PLAN, REMEMBER?
Wirt: I LIED.
Greg: AW, COME ON.
LET'S GO, CAPTAIN!
LEAD THE WAY!
YOU CAN DO IT!
Wirt: [ SIGHS ]
The Beast: YES. YES.
ALL HOPE WILL SOON BE LOST.
WE'RE LUCKY THE BOY HAD THE
PLUCK TO BEST YOU.
YOUR PLAY COULD HAVE COST US
BOTH.
DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT KEEPING THE
LANTERN LIT?
DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR
DAUGHTER'S SOUL?
The Woodsman: ONE CANNOT TRADE THE SOULS OF
CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE TOKENS!
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.
The Beast: NO. THERE IS ONLY ME.
THERE IS ONLY MY WAY.
THERE IS ONLY THE FOREST, AND
THERE IS ONLY SURRENDER.

'CAUSE DINOSAUR EARS DON'T HAVE

Wirt: CAN WE PLEASE STOP PRETENDING
WE'RE GONNA GET HOME?
Greg: HUH?
Wirt: CAN WE ADMIT WE'RE LOST FOR
GOOD?
THAT THIS FOG IS DEEPER THAN WE
CAN EVER UNDERSTAND?
THAT WE ARE BUT WAYWARD LEAVES,
SCATTERED TO THE AIR BY AN
INDIFFERENT WIND?
CAN WE JUST ADMIT WE'RE NEVER
GONNA GET BACK HOME, GREG?
CAN WE DO THAT?
Greg: WIRT, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IF
YOU SET YOUR MIND TO IT.
THAT'S WHAT THE OLD PEOPLE SAY.
Wirt: WELL, THEN LET'S DO THAT.
Greg: YES, SIR, CAPTAIN!
[ BUGLE PLAYS ]
Wirt: GREG!
YOU NEED TO STOP ACTING
RIDICULOUS ALL THE TIME.
Greg: HUH?
Wirt: LOOK, DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHY
WE GOT LOST IN THE FIRST PLACE?
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WERE GOOFING
AROUND AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.
Greg: REALLY?
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT?
Wirt: YEAH, SO...IT'S NOT MY JOB TO
GET US HOME, OKAY?
I'M DONE.
Greg: ARE YOU SAYING I SHOULD BE
THE LEADER?
Wirt: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.
Greg: BUT IF I'M THE LEADER...
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?
Wirt: I'LL BE ASLEEP.
Greg: WOW.
WELL, THEN I BETTER TAKE A NAP,
TOO.
I NEED TO DREAM UP A GOOD WAY OF
LEADING US HOME.
THANKS FOR TRUSTING ME, WIRT.
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.
I'LL BE A GOOD LEADER.
GOOD NIGHT.
[ BREATHES DEEPLY ]
STAR, OH, STAR, UP IN THE SKY,
